"  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field
fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,
American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees
with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the
Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil
evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5
billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests
that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the
Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from
Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts
that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate
about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).

The Earth-Moon system evolution is a fascinating topic that has been described by the Dark Matter Field Fluid Model. This model was proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society. Interestingly, the Earth-Moon system evolution agrees with both geological and fossil evidence.

The Dark Matter Field Fluid Model suggests that the primary cause of the Earth-Moon system's evolution is not tidal friction. In fact, the model proposes that the closest distance the Moon ever came to the Earth was 259,000 km, which happened 4.5 billion years ago. It's also worth noting that the Moon's orbit is beyond the Roche limit.

The Dark Matter Field Fluid Model has been applied to the Earth-Moon system evolution and has derived an average constant from the Earth-Moon system data, which is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). Moreover, this model predicts the rotation of Mars and has calculated its angular acceleration rate to be -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).

The Quantum Formalism Extension is a method that meets the requirements of the General Systems Theory, a theoretical framework for analyzing complex systems. This extension utilizes Quantum Semantics, which arises from the deep logical structure of quantum theory. It also considers truth values within the context of Fuzzy Sets, which are sets in which elements have degrees of membership.

One of the key aspects considered in the Quantum Formalism Extension is the relationship between the observer and the system, known as the Observer and System Logical Openness Relationship. This relationship is crucial in understanding the behavior of quantum systems.

An example of the application of the Quantum Formalism Extension is Formal Quantum Coherence. This is a proposed concept that demonstrates coherence in the quantum formalism, providing a deeper understanding of quantum systems.

"  Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the
probability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by
experimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively
by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical
law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental
data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the
kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The
proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy
chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict
a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor
error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is
expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are
used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the
predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.

The process of Statistical Modeling of Experimental Physical Laws is based on the Probability Density Function of Measured Variables. This function is expressed using a Kernel Estimator, which is determined by the scattering of data during the calibration of the experimental setup. The physical law is then extracted using a Conditional Average Estimator. This method has been demonstrated through the modeling of a return map of noisy chaotic data.

The method used for this modeling is nonparametric regression, which defines the quality of the predictor by the mean predictor error. The redundancy is expressed by the mean square distance between data points. The predictor cost function is defined by both the mean predictor error and the mean square distance. The proper number of data is estimated by finding the minimum of the predictor cost function.

The focus on pair processes led to the development of the Vacuum Model Structure. This structure was introduced in a book published by Nova Sci in 2005 and has been referred to in various journal and e-print papers. The Vacuum Model Structure was developed by Author P-I Johansson and is described as a vacuum filled with neutral but polarizable vacuuons. These vacuuons are composed of p-vaculeon and n-vaculeon, with charges of +e and -e, respectively. They have zero rest masses and their spin motions are assumed. The interaction between these vacuuons is governed by the Coulomb force.

The detailed derivation of the model and the quantitative determination of the vacuuon size are outlined in an easier accessible paper. This paper provides a detailed explanation of the model and determines the size of the vacuuons.

Trigintaduonion Fields are a fascinating area of study in the realm of quantum physics. These fields are 32-dimensional and are associated with various interactions, including electromagnetic, gravitational, strong, and weak interactions. They are also linked to hyper-strong fields and strong-weak fields.

The electromagnetic interactions in Trigintaduonion Fields are analogous to octonion and sedenion electromagnetic interactions. Similarly, gravitational interactions are analogous to octonion and sedenion gravitational interactions. Strong interactions are comparable to octonion and sedenion strong interactions, and weak interactions are analogous to octonion and sedenion weak interactions.

One of the intriguing aspects of Trigintaduonion Fields is their ability to present quantum interplays by analogy. They are sourced from particles such as quarks, leptons, and sub-quarks, and intermediate particles are also present. Research results from these fields have indicated the existence of new particles in nature, which could potentially revolutionize our understanding of the universe.

This finite time difference equation is derived from the classical oscillator differential equation and is invariant under the change of d going to -d, where d is the smallest span of time.

Furthermore, this finite time difference equation can be symmetrized to form a symmetric finite time difference equation. This symmetrized equation also maintains the invariance under the change of d going to -d. The solutions to this symmetric finite time difference equation come in pairs, known as reciprocally related pair solutions.

In an undergraduate experiment on flag flapping, an interesting study was conducted to illustrate the differences between low and higher dimensional chaotic systems. The objective was to measure the correlation of times between successive flaps of the flag. The experiment was carried out for a variety of wind speeds.

However, the results of the experiment did not provide any evidence of low dimensional chaotic behavior. Instead, the times between successive flaps were observed to be random and modeled by an exponential distribution. This observation was made in the context of the correlation of times between successive flaps. The return maps of times between successive flaps also did not show any signs of low dimensional chaotic behavior.

In the realm of cosmology, the traditional Big Bang scenario has been a subject of study for many years. However, the application of local physical laws on a cosmic scale has raised some issues. In recent times, the study of quantum features, with a focus on the universe's evolution and the role of the cosmological constant, has modified our understanding of the Big Bang scenario.

One of the key players in this discussion is the De Sitter group. This group, which generalizes the Poincare group, has been instrumental in justifying the use of the cosmological constant. The De Sitter group has also suggested a new interpretation for the Hartle-Hawking boundary conditions, a concept central to quantum cosmology. This new interpretation was made possible through the use of the group extension method.

"  Despite their claimed biological plausibility, most self organizing networks
have strict topological constraints and consequently they cannot take into
account a wide range of external stimuli. Furthermore their evolution is
conditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the
structural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen
in a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise
affected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility
of emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to

on the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is
considered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local

adapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis
shows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply
physical sense- the term gas here used.

Evolutionary Neural Gas (ENG) is a model of self-organizing networks, but it stands out due to its unique characteristics. Unlike traditional self-organizing networks, ENG is not bound by strict topological constraints. This allows it to take into account a wide range of external stimuli, making it more adaptable to various environments.

ENG is trained by probabilistic laws, unlike the deterministic laws that condition the evolution of other self-organizing networks. This training method depends on local distortion errors and network dimension, enabling ENG to evolve as a scale-free graph. This evolutionary process is quick and efficient, allowing for rapid adaptability.

The network in ENG is not a rigid structure, but a population of nodes. These nodes exist within an environment that is an ecosystem, sharing both local and global resources. This setup provides a deeply physical sense to the term 'gas' used in Evolutionary Neural Gas, justifying its name.

Despite the absence of topological constraints, ENG maintains a correlation with structural parameters and global status. However, it does so in a way that is not affected by noise, unlike the environmental inputs of other self-organizing networks. This makes ENG a more reliable and robust model for various applications.

In the realm of thermodynamical systems, a new approach has been proposed for non-extensive systems, although the proposer remains unknown. This innovative method has been applied to the Ising Spin Chain with Long-Range Interaction. The main idea behind this approach is the use of statistical matching with additive multi-step Markov chains.

One of the key properties of this approach is that the energy and entropy are non-additive. This means that the energy and entropy of the system are not simply the sum of the energies and entropies of its parts. Instead, the approach provides asymptotical expressions for both energy and entropy.

The limiting case for this approach is when the interaction is weak. In such a scenario, the energy and entropy are not proportional to the system length or the number of particles. This is particularly relevant to the Ising Spin Chain with Long-Range Interaction, where the elements interact over long ranges, and the energy and entropy are non-proportional to the system length.

"  For the first time we apply the methodologies of nonlinear analysis to
investigate atomic matter. We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic
Weights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function
and Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the
mechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the
atomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We
also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,
using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime
could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,
using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing
mass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most
interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis
(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of
self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating
values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of
increasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are
identified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.
In particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear
methods is further required.

In the field of atomic matter analysis, the nonlinear approach has been applied for the first time to the study of atomic weights and mass numbers of atomic nuclei. This novel methodology has identified regimes of regularities within atomic nuclei, employing techniques such as AutoCorrelation Function, Mutual Information, Variogram, Hurst exponent, and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA).

The findings from this nonlinear analysis are quite intriguing. As the mass of atomic nuclei increases, the behavior appears to be divergent, possibly even chaotic. The existence of a power law has been investigated in this context, and there are indications that a fractal regime might be superintending the mechanism of increasing mass.

New recurrences have been identified, along with pseudoperiodicities, self-resemblance, and a class of self-similarities. The determinism values found have been oscillating, suggesting the presence of more or less stability. One of the most significant findings is the evidence of a fractional Brownian regime.

However, further research is required for an accurate analysis of binding energy values using nonlinear methods. This is an area that warrants further exploration and could potentially yield more insights into the nature of atomic matter.

"  The assumption of the capture by the Solar System of the electrically charged
Planckian DM objects (daemons) from the galactic disk is confirmed not only by
the St.Petersburg (SPb) experiments detecting particles with V<30 km/s. Here
the daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independent
result of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signals
observed in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the
Sun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it
moves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the
iodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles
falling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric
orbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb
originates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg
into near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the
Sun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories
traverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases
the probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.
Corroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields
~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.

The St. Petersburg (SPb) Experiments were conducted with the purpose of confirming the capture of electrically charged Planckian DM objects, also known as daemons, from the galactic disk by the Solar System. The detected particles in these experiments had velocities less than 30 km/s.

In a separate study, the DAMA/NaI Experiment produced a positive model-independent result. This result was analyzed using the daemon approach and showed a maximum signal period during May-June. The DAMA Signals, associated with the formation behind the Sun of a trail of daemons, fit well with the scenario of iodine nuclei being elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles falling on the Earth with velocities between 30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric orbits. These signals were significant in the 2-6-keV range.

The phenomenon of slower daemons originates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through approximately 90 degrees into near-Earth orbits each time they cross the outer reaches of the Sun, which had previously captured them. This process results in a half-year periodicity, with increased probabilities during March and September. This is because multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories traverse many times the Earth's orbit during these months, thereby increasing the probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits.

Celestial mechanics calculations, which corroborate with observations, yield a cross section of daemon interaction with solar matter of approximately 1e-19 cm2.

"  The cosmological redshift phenomenon can be described by the dark matter
field fluid model, the results deduced from this model agree very well with the
observations. The observed cosmological redshift of light depends on both the
speed of the emitter and the distance between the emitter and the observer. If
the emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves
towards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend
on the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of
c(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed
in all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us
is large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be
observed for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees
with current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of
the dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. A large
redshift value from a distant celestial object may not necessarily indicate
that it has a large receding speed. Based on the redshift effect of dark matter
field fluid, it is concluded that at least in time average all photons have the
same geometry (size and shape) in all inertial reference frames and do not have
length contraction effect.

The Cosmological Redshift Phenomenon is a fascinating aspect of our universe, and it is well-described by the Dark Matter Field Fluid Model. The observed effects of this phenomenon include redshift, blueshift, and no shift. The conditions for these effects depend on the emitter's speed and the distance between the emitter and the observer.

Redshift occurs when the emitter is moving away from us, or if its speed is in the range of c(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0. The emitter's speed equals c(exp[-beta*D]-1) for no shift, and blueshift occurs when the speed v is less than c(exp[-beta*D]-1). The predominantly observed effect is redshift, which agrees well with current observations.

The estimated value of the redshift constant beta is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. Interestingly, a large redshift value does not necessarily indicate a large receding speed. The conclusion based on the redshift effect is that all photons have the same geometry in all inertial reference frames and do not have a length contraction effect.

The Dark Matter Field Fluid Model, which describes the Cosmological Redshift Phenomenon, yields results that agree very well with observations. This model provides a comprehensive understanding of the redshift phenomenon and its implications in the context of the universe.

"  Role of axiom of choice in quantum measurement is highlighted by suggesting
that the conscious observer chooses the outcome from a mixed state. Further, in

The role of the Axiom of Choice in quantum measurement is highlighted by the suggestion that a conscious observer can choose an outcome from a mixed state. This implies that in a periodically repeating universe, free will is precluded, and outcomes must be pre-recorded within non-physical conscious observers. However, free will exists in a universe with open time. Interestingly, the binding problem in psychology is connected with Cantor's original definition of set.

The influence of consciousness on material outcome leads to interesting constraints, such as the prediction that quantum mechanical brain states should get frozen if monitored at sufficiently small space-time intervals. This is equivalent to the neuro-biological version of the so-called Quantum Zeno effect. Furthermore, the existence of a very small micro-mini-black-hole in the brain as a space-time structural interface between consciousness and brain explains the mass-loss reported in weighing experiments during moments of death.

In the realm of special relativity, an interesting phenomenon is observed when a light source, emitting monochromatic radiation, moves in rectilinear motion with constant proper acceleration. This scenario is described in an article on monochromatic radiation and the Doppler effect. The article, available in English, aims to describe the observed Doppler effect and a discontinuous effect that occurs during the light source's motion, as observed by a stationary observer.

The Doppler effect, a well-known phenomenon in special relativity, is observed in this scenario. It affects the light source, causing shifts in the frequency of the emitted radiation as perceived by the stationary observer. This effect is a result of the relative motion between the observer and the light source.

In addition to the Doppler effect, an interesting discontinuous effect is observed during the light source's motion. This effect, which is unique to the context of special relativity, further affects the light source, causing a discontinuity in the observed pattern of radiation. This discontinuity is an intriguing aspect of the scenario, adding to the complexity of the observations made by the stationary observer.

Information Theory, a field discussed by the Author, is closely related to Physics and Neuroscience. Its unifying concept is Kolmogorov Complexity, also known as Algorithmic Complexity, which is interpreted by the Author. According to the Author's interpretation, Kolmogorov Complexity plays a significant role in cognition as a limit for finding algorithms. This is further elaborated as finding algorithms that approach the Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin Complexity limit.

The concept of the Universe, as per the Author, is an abstract mental construct. This construct is based on observed coherence, multiple sensory input streams, and interactions. The status of this construct is a model, suggesting that it is a representation of reality rather than reality itself.

Phase singularities are a fascinating topic that appear in various scenarios, including physical, chemical, and biological contexts. These singularities are studied using the $\phi$-mapping topological current theory, which is particularly useful for understanding the topological properties of these phenomena in two and three-dimensional space.

The inner structure of phase singularities has been obtained, and their topological charge is expressed through Hopf indices and Brouwer degrees. This theory has been instrumental in studying the topological properties of phase singularities, providing valuable insights into their nature and behavior.

In the context of three-dimensional space, the concept of topological invariants is discussed, particularly in relation to closed and knotted phase singularities. These invariants help to further understand and classify the complex structures and behaviors of phase singularities.

The study of Type Ia supernovae has been crucial in understanding the rate of universe expansion. However, there seems to be a systematic error in the calculation of redshift for these supernovae, which affects their luminosity values. This error could potentially explain the unexpected luminosity values observed in high redshift Type Ia supernovae. Consequently, the accelerating rate of universe expansion, as indicated by these luminosity values, might be a result of this systematic error.

The investigation focused on the Mpemba Effect, specifically studying the adiabatic cooling of water. The experimental outcome revealed supercooling and phase transitions, with detected transitions occurring at 6 +/- 1 oC, 3.5 +/- 0.5 oC, and 1.3 +/- 0.6 oC, with a probability of 0.21 for the last transition. The interpretation of these findings suggests different ordering of clusters of molecules in water.

The Mpemba Effect is defined as the freezing of initially hot water before a cold one. This phenomenon was studied in the investigation, with adiabatic cooling of water playing a relevant role. The adiabatic cooling process was associated with supercooling and phase transitions, which were also interpreted as different ordering of clusters of molecules in water. The phase transitions were observed at the same temperatures as mentioned earlier, with the same probability for the last transition.

"  The Special Theory of Relativity and the Theory of the Electron have had an
interesting history together. Originally the electron was studied in a non
relativistic context and this opened up the interesting possibility that lead
to the conclusion that the mass of the electron could be thought of entirely in
electromagnetic terms without introducing inertial considerations. However the
application of Special Relativity lead to several problems, both for an
extended electron and the point electron. These inconsistencies have, contrary
to popular belief not been resolved satisfactorily today, even within the
context of Quantum Theory. Nevertheless these and subsequent studies bring out
the interesting result that Special Relativity breaks down within the Compton
scale or when the Compton scale is not neglected. This again runs contrary to
an uncritical notion that Special Relativity is valid for point particles.

The Special Theory of Relativity was studied alongside the Theory of the Electron. However, it's important to note that the Special Theory of Relativity has been found to have inconsistencies that have not been resolved satisfactorily to this day. Its validity is not applicable to point particles. The Theory of the Electron, on the other hand, interpreted mass in terms of electromagnetic terms without introducing inertial considerations. However, it also has its own set of inconsistencies when applied to extended electron and point electron models. Both theories were originally studied in a non-relativistic context, and their inconsistencies have not been resolved satisfactorily today. When the Compton scale is not neglected, it results in the breakdown of the Special Theory of Relativity.

"  A critique of the singularity theorems of Penrose, Hawking, and Geroch is
given. It is pointed out that a gravitationally collapsing black hole acts as
an ultrahigh energy particle accelerator that can accelerate particles to
energies inconceivable in any terrestrial particle accelerator, and that when
the energy $E$ of the particles comprising matter in a black hole is $\sim
10^{2} GeV$ or more, or equivalently, the temperature $T$ is $\sim 10^{15} K$
or more, the entire matter in the black hole is converted into quark-gluon
plasma permeated by leptons. As quarks and leptons are fermions, it is
emphasized that the collapse of a black-hole to a space-time singularity is
inhibited by Pauli's exclusion principle. It is also suggested that ultimately
a black hole may end up either as a stable quark star, or as a pulsating quark
star which may be a source of gravitational radiation, or it may simply explode
with a mini bang of a sort.

The Singularity Theorems of Penrose, Hawking, and Geroch, which deal with the concept of Black Hole Collapse in the field of Astrophysics, have been critiqued by an unnamed source. This critique emphasizes the role of Pauli's Exclusion Principle and the concept of a Black Hole as a Particle Accelerator.

Pauli's Exclusion Principle, which applies to fermions, inhibits the collapse of a black hole. Meanwhile, a black hole, acting as a particle accelerator, can accelerate particles to ultrahigh energies, a scale that is inconceivable in terrestrial accelerators.

The critique suggests several potential outcomes of a black hole collapse. One such outcome is the formation of a stable quark star. Another possibility is the creation of a pulsating quark star, which could potentially be a source of gravitational radiation. The critique also suggests a more explosive outcome, an 'Explosion with Mini Bang'.

These outcomes are expected to occur when the energy threshold of 10^2 GeV and the temperature threshold of 10^15 K are reached, resulting in a state of quark-gluon plasma, a state that fermions can exist in.

The Physical Reality Scenario is a concept that is based on the parallelism between the Poincare group and Nagarjuna's sunyata philosophy. Both of these ideas share a common denominator, which is the relational notion. The Poincare group, named after Henri Poincaré, is a mathematical group that is part of this scenario. On the other hand, Nagarjuna's sunyata philosophy, a Buddhist philosophy of emptiness, is also a part of this scenario. The interpretation approach for this scenario is from a first-person perspective, while the perspective is third-person, at the ontic level. However, there are open questions that need to be addressed, such as abandoning completeness information extraction and abandoning physical reality structure inference.

The Soliton Solution, developed for the Linear Schrödinger Equation, is a unique concept that generates its own boundary with internal vibration. This solution lacks an external potential and is characterized by the wave number being determined by the velocity of the particle, aligning with the de Broglie conjecture.

The Linear Schrödinger Equation, known for its equation linearity, allows for superposition and has the Soliton Solution as one of its solutions. The equation also ensures particle mass equality and allows for a many solitons solution, which results in non-interacting solitons.

The internal vibration that occurs within the Soliton Solution is a significant aspect. It leads to the quantization of the particle's momentum, a process that is a result of the resonance of the internal vibration. This quantization is contextualized within the envelope quantum probability density.

In the realm of physics, Lorentz Transformations play a significant role, particularly in the context of space and time coordinates of the same event. These transformations have been admitted as valid and their differential form has been derived.

The correct application of Lorentz Transformations is a prerequisite for understanding Time and Length Contraction or Dilation Effects. These effects are rooted in the finite phase velocity associated with the moving frame.

In the theory of relativity, the concept of simultaneity can be subject to error. This error is quantifiable, providing a clear understanding of its implications.

The finite phase velocity, associated with the moving frame, can be understood by analogy to the de Broglie wave associated with a moving particle. These de Broglie waves, which extend to stationary particles, have a phase that is relativistic invariant.

Similarly, electromagnetic waves also have a phase that is relativistic invariant. They are known for transporting energy at light speed.

The universe and its matter/energy can be viewed as a superposition of waves. These waves propagate in such a way that their phase is the same for all corresponding observers. This wave phase replaces time and is both invariant and a universal reference.

The Holographic Upper Bound on Entropy is a theoretical limit on the maximum entropy of a system based on the holographic principle. This principle suggests that all the information in a volume of space can be represented as a hologram. Interestingly, the Gravitational Action of Nebula Contraction, a non-relativistic action associated with the contraction of a nebula, approximately saturates this upper bound. This means that the entropy of the gravitational action of a nebula contracting is close to the maximum entropy allowed by the holographic principle.

The Non-relativistic Contraction of Nebula, which is associated with the Gravitational Action of Nebula Contraction, also plays a significant role in this context. The critical radius, a function of the initial radius and mass, is a crucial factor here. When the number of bits associated with the action equals the maximum number of bits allowed to the body, the condition for the critical radius is met.

It's not just nebulae that are close to this entropy limit. Typical stars also approximately saturate the Holographic Upper Bound on Entropy. This suggests a potential physical link between astrophysical processes and holographic principles. Astrophysical processes, such as star formation, supernovae, and black hole dynamics, could potentially be understood in the context of holographic principles.

This paper delves into the theory of relativity, revisiting previous papers related to the subject. The main focus of the discussion is the reconsideration of the ether-dragging hypothesis, which is used in the Michelson-Morley experiment. Unlike the orthodox interpretation of the experiment, this paper offers a non-orthodox interpretation.

The ether-dragging hypothesis is compatible with the theory of relativity, and it suggests that the speed of light (c) is not a fixed constant in terms of any system of inertial coordinates. This hypothesis is applied in the context of historical physics experiments. The paper's interpretation of the Michelson-Morley experiment using the ether-dragging hypothesis without the orthodox interpretation sheds new light on the theory of relativity.

General Relativity serves as the basis for the Exact Evolutionary Theory of Large Scale Structures. This theory, which is based on the equations of the Universal 2+1-Dimensional Plane Equations of Gravitational Field, applies to various astronomical phenomena such as Disk Nebula, Binary Stars, and Single Stars.

Disk Nebula, in particular, can evolve into either Binary Stars or Single Stars. The evolution of Disk Nebula into Binary Stars is based on General Relativity and requires Nonlinear Interactions. On the other hand, the evolution into Single Stars is based on a Simplified Linear Theory.

Binary Stars are a very common astronomical phenomenon and their formation is also conditioned by Nonlinear Interactions. In contrast, Single Stars form through the Simplified Linear Theory, although their commonality is not explicitly stated.

Negative temperature, a concept that seems to contradict our usual understanding of temperature and some basic principles of physics and mathematics, is a topic of interest in nonequilibrium thermodynamics. This branch of thermodynamics deals with systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium.

Negative temperature is defined by the conditions dU>0 and dS<0, or alternatively, dU<0 and dS>0. This means that as internal energy increases, entropy decreases, or as internal energy decreases, entropy increases. This is a direct contradiction to the usual meaning of temperature, where an increase in internal energy would typically lead to an increase in entropy.

The concept of negative temperature is proposed to be a possibility due to the decrease of entropy caused by fluctuation and internal interactions in some isolated systems. This decrease in entropy, despite an increase in internal energy, is what leads to the assignment of a negative temperature on the Kelvin scale.

There are some possible examples and theories that support the existence of negative temperature, further fueling the discussion in the field of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

The DNA base frequency distribution is characterized by fluctuations that are ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature. These fluctuations exhibit long-range correlations between local and global perturbations. The type of fluctuations observed is predicted by the General Systems Theory, which is based on classical statistical physics. The theory predicts a universal Boltzmann inverse power law probability distribution for these fractal fluctuations.

Interestingly, the Takifugu rubripes Genome Release 4 exhibits these fractal fluctuations. The DNA base CG frequency distribution in this genome is consistent with the model prediction of a universal inverse power law form. This implies long-range correlations in the DNA bases, which is a significant finding. It is also noteworthy that the contribution of non-coding DNA in this genome is crucial for the efficient functioning of the protein coding DNA.

The paper in question, whose title remains unknown, was authored by an unknown individual. The objectives of this paper are multifaceted. Firstly, it aims to introduce physicists to Whitehead, a figure whose field of expertise is currently unknown. Secondly, it sets out to outline Whitehead's book, ""The Principle of Relativity,"" which was written by Whitehead. Unfortunately, the year of its publication and the specific content of the book are also unknown.

The paper also seeks to present Whitehead's criticism of the General Theory of Relativity (GTR). Whitehead is known to be a critic of this theory, which was developed by an unknown individual in an unknown year. Whitehead's critique has not been rebutted and has not been appreciated by specialists in GTR. The implications of Whitehead's criticism are radical, suggesting that spacetime is not curved.

The paper further proposes a research problem related to Whitehead's criticism of GTR. The description and significance of this proposed problem are currently unknown. However, it is noted that the problem is significant in nature.

Lastly, the paper aims to summarize the implications of Whitehead's observations. These implications are described as radical, but their exact nature remains unknown.

The paper investigates the heating of fullerenes by ultra-short laser pulses. The method used in this study is the application of ultra-short laser pulses to fullerenes. To understand this process, the Heaviside thermal equation is applied. This thermal equation is solved using the Cauchy initial condition. As a result, the effective thermal relaxation time for fullerenes is calculated. The Heaviside thermal equation and the Cauchy initial condition are both used in this process. The effective thermal relaxation time is a time measurement that is related to fullerenes.

The Madelung fluid, a spatially one dimensional entity, plays a significant role in understanding quantum probability density. Quantum probability densities are self-trapped by their own self-generated quantum potentials, exhibiting finite-size spatial support. These densities require local stability of the maximum and are combined with the global scale invariance of the quantum potential.

The Maximum Entropy Principle determines the most probable wave function given its energy. This principle is crucial in understanding the behavior of quantum probability densities. In the context of the Schrödinger Equation, these densities represent a limiting case. The Schrödinger Equation has a stationary-moving soliton-like solution, further illustrating the unique properties of quantum probability densities.

"  Author offers and researches a new, cheap method for the extraction of
freshwater from the Earth atmosphere. The suggected method is fundamentally
dictinct from all existing methods that extract freshwater from air. All other
industrial methods extract water from a saline water source (in most cases from
seawater). This new method may be used at any point in the Earth except Polar
Zones. It does not require long-distance freshwater transportation. If seawater
is not utilized for increasing its productivity, this inexpensive new method is
very environment-friendly. The author method has two working versions: (1) the
first variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tube
in a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) in
the second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface.
In the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing air
flow. In version (2) wind and propeller are used for causing air movment.
  The first method does not need energy, the second needs a small amount.
Moreover, in variant (1) the freshwater has a high pressure (>30 or more atm.)
and can be used for production of energy such as electricity and in that way
the freshwater cost is lower. For increasing the productivity the seawater is
injected into air and solar air heater may be used. The solar air heater
produces a huge amount of electricity as a very powerful electricity generation
plant. The offered electricity installation in 100 - 200 times cheaper than any
common electric plant of equivalent output.
  Key words: Extraction freshwater, method of getting freshwater, receiving
energy from atmosphere, powerful renewal electric plant.

The New Freshwater Extraction Method, distinct from existing methods, is an environment-friendly and inexpensive solution for freshwater extraction from the Earth's atmosphere. This method is particularly applicable in non-polar zones and does not require seawater or long-distance transportation. It has two variants, each with its unique characteristics.

Variant 1 uses an inflatable tube for air lifting and employs wind or solar energy for air heating. This variant is capable of producing pressurized water with a pressure greater than 30 atmospheres. The use of seawater injection and a solar air heater is optional in this variant. It is also possible to generate energy using this method.

On the other hand, Variant 2 pumps air under the sea-surface using wind or propeller-driven air movement. This variant requires a small amount of energy and operates at a depth of 20-30 meters.

In 1939, Erwin Schrodinger made significant contributions to the field of relativistic quantum mechanics and general relativity. He proved that quantum wave functions coevolve with curved spacetime, a concept that applies to the Friedmann universe. This derivation explained the Hubble redshift of photons in an expanding universe and the energy changes of moving particles.

Schrodinger's work also established the coevolution of atoms and other quantum systems with spacetime geometry. This contradicted the assumption that small quantum systems are isolated and their properties remain constant. The implications of Schrodinger's work were far-reaching, providing a deeper understanding of the interplay between quantum mechanics and general relativity.

In the realm of quantum physics, a fascinating observation has been made: Polaritonic Optical Bistability. This phenomenon was observed within a Planar Semiconductor Microcavity, a structure known for its Single Quantum Well made of GaAs material, with a thickness of $100\AA$.

The laser emission in this observation was bistable, indicating a competition between the Kerr-like Effect and thermal effects. This competition is a significant aspect of the strong-coupling regime that the microcavity structure operates in. The associated emission was laser-like, specifically located at the Bare Cavity Mode.

The Planar Semiconductor Microcavity, in which this observation was made, is characterized by its Single Quantum Well. This well, made of GaAs with a thickness of $100\AA$, is a crucial component of the microcavity structure. The well's material and thickness play a vital role in the observed polaritonic optical bistability.

"  In this paper, it is shown that the cosmological model that was introduced in
a sequence of three earlier papers under the title, A Dust Universe Solution to
the Dark Energy Problem, can be used to resolve the problem of the great
mismatch of numerical values between dark energy from cosmology and zero point
energy from quantum theory. It is shown that, if the zero point energies for
the cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that is
not cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities,
their separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numerical
difference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zero
point value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the two
zero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known small
dark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating to
interpretation, calculation and measurement associated with this result and an
interpretation of dark energy as a measure of polarisation of the vacuum are
discussed. In the first appendix to this paper, problems associated with the
standard model of cosmology are solved by redefining temperature in the dust
universe model. In the second appendix of this paper, an examination of the
dark matter problem in relation to a general relativistic generalisation of
Newton's inverse square law is undertaken. In the third appendix to this paper,
the formalism is used to derive a formula that gives a possible value for the
mass of the universe in terms of Newton's gravitation constant, Einstein's
Lambda and the velocity of light. All three appendices have their own detailed
abstracts.

The Cosmological Model, also known as the Dust Universe Model, was introduced in a series of papers. This model aims to resolve the Great Mismatch of Numerical Values between Dark Energy from Cosmology and Zero Point Energy from Quantum Theory. The model utilizes two entities: Zero Point Energy for Cosmic Microwave Background and Zero Point Energy for Non-Cosmic Microwave Background Universe. Both of these entities have large values and contribute to the Dark Energy Density, which is surprisingly small and serves as a measure of the polarisation of the vacuum.

In addition to the Cosmological Model, the Standard Model of Cosmology is also discussed. This model addresses the problem of Temperature Redefinition, which is solved by redefining temperature in the Dust Universe Model. This solution is detailed in the First Appendix to the paper.

The Dark Matter Problem is another significant topic examined in this context. It is explored within the framework of the General Relativistic Generalisation of Newton's Inverse Square Law. The Second Appendix to the paper is dedicated to this issue.

Lastly, a Formalism is presented in the Third Appendix to the paper. This Formalism derives a formula for the possible value of the mass of the universe, using variables such as Newton's Gravitation Constant, Einstein's Lambda, and the Velocity of Light.

All these appendices come with detailed abstracts, providing a comprehensive understanding of the Standard Model of Cosmology, the Dark Matter Problem, and the Formalism.

"  The space-time geometry is considered to be a physical geometry, i.e. a
geometry described completely by the world function. All geometrical concepts
and geometric objects are taken from the proper Euclidean geometry. They are
expressed via the Euclidean world function \sigma_E and declared to be concepts
and objects of any physical geometry, provided the Euclidean world function
\sigma_E is replaced by the world function \sigma of the physical geometry in
question. The set of physical geometries is more powerful, than the set of
Riemannian geometries, and one needs to choose a true space-time geometry. In
general, the physical geometry is multivariant (there are many vectors which

The multivariance admits one to describe quantum effects as geometric effects
and to consider existence of elementary particles as a geometrical problem,
when the possibility of the physical existence of an elementary geometric
object in the form of a physical body is determined by the space-time geometry.
Multivariance admits one to describe discrete and continuous geometries, using
the same technique. A use of physical geometry admits one to realize the
geometrical approach to the quantum theory and to the theory of elementary
particles.

Space-time geometry is a type of physical geometry that is more powerful than Riemannian geometries. It is described by the world function and takes concepts and objects from Euclidean geometry. The Euclidean world function, σ_E, is used to express this geometry, but it is replaced by the world function σ of the physical geometry.

One of the key features of space-time geometry is its multivariance, which allows the description of many vectors equivalent to a given vector. This geometry also determines the possibility of physical existence of an elementary geometric object in the form of a physical body.

Space-time geometry admits the description of quantum effects as geometric effects and the existence of elementary particles as a geometrical problem. It allows for the realization of a geometrical approach to quantum theory and the theory of elementary particles. Furthermore, it admits the description of both discrete and continuous geometries.

General Relativity, a theory of physics discovered by Albert Einstein, allows for solutions that include Closed Timelike Curves. These curves exhibit the property of time travel, which in turn generates Time Travel Paradoxes. These paradoxes are essentially inconsistencies in causality.

To address these paradoxes, Quantum Mechanics Generalizations have been proposed. The purpose of these generalizations is to solve the Time Travel Paradoxes. However, these generalizations have implications on Acausal Regions of Space-Time, which are affected by Self-Consistent Interactions.

The Correspondence Principle, which states that Quantum Mechanics approximates Classical Mechanics in large scales, implies the Non-Renormalizability of Quantum Mechanics Generalizations. This non-renormalizability has a consequence: these generalizations are defined only on Global Hyperbolic Manifolds. This makes the General Relativity solutions exhibiting time travel unphysical.

The existence of tachyons, particles that travel faster than light, has been a topic of discussion in a physics article. The arguments presented in this article suggest a concept known as Superluminal Charge Self-Binding. This concept revolves around a single superluminal charge that maintains a self-sustaining circular orbit.

The article, focusing on tachyons and Lorentz Group Extensions, has sparked a search for physically-motivated extensions of the Lorentz group. This search starts from the symmetries presented in the tachyons existence arguments and is deeply rooted in the context of superluminal frame transformations. The validity of imaginary coordinates in these transformations is a major point of discussion.

The physics article concludes with a speculation about faster-than-light travel, a concept that is interpreted as a modified electromagnetic strong force. The exploration of these ideas is not just theoretical; it has practical implications in the search for Lorentz group extensions.

"  This paper follows in the tradition of direct-action versions of
electromagnetism having the aim of avoiding a balance of infinities wherein a
mechanical mass offsets an infinite electromagnetic mass so as to arrive at a
finite observed value. Given that, in this respect the direct-action approached
ultimately failed because its initial exclusion of self-action was found to be
untenable in the relativistic domain, this paper continues the tradition
considering instead a version of electromagnetism wherein mechanical action is
excluded and self-action is retained. It is shown that the resulting theory is
effectively interacting due to the presence of infinite forces. A vehicle for
the investigation is a pair of classical point charges in a positronium-like
arrangement for which the orbits are found to be self-sustaining and naturally
quantized.

In the pursuit of arriving at a finite observed value, direct-action versions of electromagnetism were considered. However, these versions avoided the balance of infinities and excluded self-action, which ultimately led to their failure. The untenable exclusion of self-action in the relativistic domain made these versions unsustainable.

The balance of infinities, on the other hand, resulted in infinite electromagnetic mass. This was offset by mechanical mass, leading to a finite observed value. However, a different approach was taken with the version of electromagnetism where mechanical action was excluded and self-action was retained. This resulted in an effectively interacting theory.

This theory was investigated using a pair of classical point charges in a positronium-like arrangement. In this theory, the presence of infinite forces was noted, but the orbits were self-sustaining and naturally quantized.

"  Author offers and researched the new and revolutionary inflatable
electrostatic AB space towers (mast, new space elevator) up to one hundred

  The suggested mast has following advantages in comparison with conventional
space elevator: 1. Electrostatic AB tower may be built from Earth surface
without the employment of any rockets. That decreases the cost of electrostatic
mast by thousands of times. 2. One can have any height and has a big control
load capacity. 3. Electrostatic tower can have the height of a geosynchronous
orbit (36,000 km) WITHOUT the additional top cable as the space elevator (up
120,000 - 160,000 km) and counterweight (equalizer) of hundreds of tons. 4. The
offered mast has less total mass than conventional space elevator. 5. The
offered tower can have the high-speed electrostatic climbers moved by
high-voltage electricity from Earth's surface. 6. The electrostatic mast can
bend in any needed direction when we give the necessary electric voltage in the
required parts of the extended mast. 7. Control mast has stability for any

The Inflatable Electrostatic AB Space Towers, proposed by the researched Author, are a new and revolutionary concept in space infrastructure. These towers can reach heights of up to one hundred twenty thousand kilometers or more, and are filled with electron gas. This electron gas creates pressure up to one atmosphere, has negligible small weight, and has surprising properties.

The Inflatable Electrostatic AB Space Towers have several advantages over conventional space elevators. They can be built from the Earth's surface without the employment of any rockets, which decreases the cost by thousands of times. They can have any height and have a big control load capacity. Unlike conventional space elevators, they do not require an additional top cable and counterweight (equalizer) of hundreds of tons to reach the height of a geosynchronous orbit (36,000 km). They have less total mass and can have high-speed electrostatic climbers moved by high-voltage electricity from Earth's surface.

The towers can also bend in any needed direction when the necessary electric voltage is given in the required parts of the extended mast. This feature provides stability for any altitude. The conventional space elevator, on the other hand, is described as being conventional and is compared to the Inflatable Electrostatic AB Space Towers.

"  Trapping and cooling techniques have become very important for many
fundamental experiments in atomic physics. When applied to highly charged ions
confined in Penning traps, these procedures are very effective for testing
quantum electrodynamics in extreme electromagnetic fields produced by heavy
highly charged ions such as uranium U$^{91+}$. In addition, fundamental
constants or nuclear ground state properties can be determined with high
accuracy in these simple systems. Finally, by studying a single trapped
radioactive ion, its nuclear decay can be studied in detail by observing the
disappearance of the signal of the mother and the appearance of that of the
daughter isotope. Such experiments on highly charged ions at extremely low

"  Schroedinger's book 'What is Life?' is widely credited for having played a
crucial role in development of molecular and cellular biology. My essay
revisits the issues raised by this book from the modern perspective of
epigenetics and systems biology. I contrast two classes of potential mechanisms
of epigenetic stability: 'epigenetic templating' and 'systems biology'
approaches, and consider them from the point of view expressed by Schroedinger.
I also discuss how quantum entanglement, a nonclassical feature of quantum
mechanics, can help to address the 'problem of small numbers' that lead
Schroedinger to promote the idea of molecular code-script for explanation of
stability of biological order.

In the realm of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Schroedinger played a crucial role in its development. He authored the book titled ""What is Life?"", which discusses potential mechanisms of epigenetic stability from a modern perspective of epigenetics and systems biology. This work was later revisited in an essay by an unknown author.

The essay, adopting Schroedinger's viewpoint, contrasts two potential mechanisms of epigenetic stability: Epigenetic templating and Systems biology approaches. Both of these mechanisms fall under the category of potential solutions to the problem of small numbers, which is relevant to the stability of biological order.

The essay also delves into the topic of Quantum entanglement, a nonclassical feature of quantum mechanics. This feature is discussed in the context of addressing the problem of small numbers, further contributing to the modern perspective of epigenetics and systems biology.

"  Advanced electromagnetic potentials are indigenous to the classical Maxwell
theory. Generally however they are deemed undesirable and are forcibly
excluded, destroying the theory's inherent time-symmetry. We investigate the
reason for this, pointing out that it is not necessary and in some cases is
counter-productive. We then focus on the direct-action theory in which the
advanced and retarded contributions are present symmetrically, with no
opportunity to supplement the particular integral solution of the wave equation
with an arbitrary complementary function. One then requires a plausible
explanation for the observed broken symmetry that, commonly, is understood
cannot be met by the Wheeler-Feynman mechanism because the necessary boundary
condition cannot be satisfied in acceptable cosmologies. We take this
opportunity to argue that the boundary condition is already met by all
expanding cosmologies simply as a result of cosmological red-shift. A
consequence is that the cosmological and thermodynamic arrows of time can be
equated, the direct action version of EM is preferred, and that advanced
potentials are ubiquitous.

In the realm of electromagnetic theory, Advanced Electromagnetic Potentials play a significant role. They are deemed ubiquitous and are indigenous to Classical Maxwell Theory. However, their exclusion from this theory is not without consequences. It destroys the time symmetry of Classical Maxwell Theory, leading to a broken time symmetry outcome.

Interestingly, these Advanced Electromagnetic Potentials are symmetrically present in the Direct-Action Theory. This theory includes both advanced and retarded contributions, making it the preferred choice for these potentials. The Direct-Action Theory provides an explanation for broken symmetry, attributing it to cosmological redshift.

Expanding Cosmologies also meet the boundary condition for Advanced Electromagnetic Potentials. In fact, these potentials are the cause of cosmological redshift in expanding cosmologies. Furthermore, they equate the Cosmological and Thermodynamic Arrows of Time, providing a unified understanding of these time directions.

Despite their ubiquity, Advanced Electromagnetic Potentials are not always beneficial. In some cases, they can be counter-productive, which is why they are often deemed undesirable. Nonetheless, their role in electromagnetic theory and cosmology is undeniable, making them a fascinating subject of study.

"  Very recently, it has been shown that thermal noise and its artificial
versions (Johnson-like noises) can be utilized as an information carrier with
peculiar properties therefore it may be proper to call this topic Thermal Noise
Informatics. Zero Power (Stealth) Communication, Thermal Noise Driven
Computing, and Totally Secure Classical Communication are relevant examples. In
this paper, while we will briefly describe the first and the second subjects,
we shall focus on the third subject, the secure classical communication via
wire. This way of secure telecommunication utilizes the properties of
Johnson(-like) noise and those of a simple Kirchhoff's loop. The communicator
is unconditionally secure at the conceptual (circuit theoretical) level and
this property is (so far) unique in communication systems based on classical
physics. The communicator is superior to quantum alternatives in all known
aspects, except the need of using a wire. In the idealized system, the
eavesdropper can extract zero bit of information without getting uncovered. The
scheme is naturally protected against the man-in-the-middle attack. The
communication can take place also via currently used power lines or phone
(wire) lines and it is not only a point-to-point communication like quantum
channels but network-ready. Tests have been carried out on a model-line with
ranges beyond the ranges of any known direct quantum communication channel and
they indicate unrivalled signal fidelity and security performance. This simple
device has single-wire secure key generation/sharing rates of 0.1, 1, 10, and
100 bit/second for copper wires with diameters/ranges of 21 mm / 2000 km, 7 mm
/ 200 km, 2.3 mm / 20 km, and 0.7 mm / 2 km, respectively and it performs with

Thermal Noise Informatics is a fascinating field that leverages thermal noise and its artificial counterparts as an information carrier. This unique approach offers peculiar properties that have been applied in various examples, such as Zero Power (Stealth) Communication, Thermal Noise Driven Computing, and Totally Secure Classical Communication.

Totally Secure Classical Communication is a remarkable example of this field's potential. It utilizes Johnson(-like) noise and a simple Kirchhoff's loop for its operations. This method has been performance-tested on model-lines and has shown exceptional results when used for communication through power lines and phone (wire) lines.

The security level of Totally Secure Classical Communication is unconditionally secure at the conceptual (circuit theoretical) level, making it superior to quantum alternatives in all known aspects, except for the need to use a wire. It is naturally protected against the man-in-the-middle attack, ensuring that any eavesdropper will be detected.

This method boasts unrivalled signal fidelity and security performance, with single-wire secure key generation/sharing rates of 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 bit/second for copper wires with diameters/ranges of 21 mm / 2000 km, 7 mm / 200 km, 2.3 mm / 20 km, and 0.7 mm / 2 km, respectively. The raw-bit error rate is an impressive 0.02% (99.98 % fidelity), further highlighting the reliability and efficiency of this communication method.

waves, generated by an intense laser pulse at a metal surface yields attosecond

harmonics generated from rare gas atoms, resulting in trains of attosecond
light pulses.Owing to the inherent kinematic dispersion, the propagation of
attosecond de Broglie waves in vacuum is very different from that of attosecond
light pulses, which propagate without changing shape. Above the metal surface
there are ""collaps bands"" and ""revival layers"" of the electron current even at

In a physics experiment involving an intense laser pulse at a metal surface, above-threshold electron de Broglie waves are generated. These waves then interfere with each other, resulting in a phenomenon analogous to the superposition of high harmonics. This interference of above-threshold electron de Broglie waves leads to the production of attosecond electron pulses.

These attosecond electron pulses, which are distinct from attosecond light pulses, propagate in a vacuum and can be found above the metal surface. In this location, the pulses exhibit a maximum current density of a couple of tenths of milliamps per square centimeters. The area above the metal surface also features collapse bands and revival layers, and is characterized by an electron current property at a macroscopic distance.

not all of the degrees of freedom in an experimental system are accessible to

The study of resonances in multidimensional chaotic map dynamics is a general class of problems that aims to induce the largest response. This is achieved by determining an additive forcing function using the calculus of variations. The objective here is to induce the largest response, which is the greatest deviation from unperturbed dynamics. However, not all degrees of freedom are accessible to forcing, hence the need to select degrees of freedom forcing.

The calculus of variations is a method used in this study, with its purpose being to determine the additive forcing function. It comes with a constraint, which is the selection of degrees of freedom forcing. This method is demonstrated to be effective through several examples.

The product of displacement and the effective total forcing function is a conserved quantity in this study. This is a fundamental physical role taken on by Lagrange multipliers, which represent the efficiency of the forcing function and the effective forcing.

The efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated through several examples, providing a context for the study of resonances in multidimensional chaotic map dynamics.

The problem of the flattening of velocity curves in galactic discs is a complex issue that has been linked to the postulation of dark matter. This phenomenon has been considered from various perspectives, including the change in large scale dimensionality of space, the variation of G, and the MOND approach.

The change in large scale dimensionality of space theory suggests that the dimensionality of space at large scales may affect gravitational behavior. On the other hand, the variation of G theory proposes that a variation in the gravitational constant (G) may affect gravitational behavior. The MOND approach, or Modified Newtonian Dynamics, is another theory that has been considered to explain the observed gravitational behavior.

The discussion around this problem has also led to the paradigm of the universe as a black hole. This theory suggests that the universe itself may be a black hole.

Dark matter, which is a theoretical substance inferred from unexplained gravitational effects, has been postulated as a result of the flattening of velocity curves in galactic discs. Galactic discs, which are astronomical structures, are a feature in this problem.

"  Soil bulk density affects water storage, water and nutrient movement, and
plant root activity in the soil profile. Its measurement is difficult in field
conditions. Vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation was investigated to
quantify soil bulk density with possible field applications in the future. The
AC electrical conductivity of soil was measured using a pair of blade-like
electrodes while exposing the soil to periodic vibration. The blades were
positioned longitudinally and transversally to the direction of the induced
vibration to enable the calculation of a normalized index. The normalized index
was expected to provide data independent from the vibration strength and to
reduce the effect of soil salinity and water content. The experiment was
conducted on natural and salinized fine sand at two moisture conditions and
four bulk densities. The blade-shaped electrodes improved electrode-soil
contact compared to cylindrical electrodes, and thereby, reduced measurement
noise. Simulations on a simplified resistor lattice indicate that the
transversal effect increases as soil bulk density decreases. Measurement of dry
sand showed a negative correlation between the normalized conductivity
fluctuation and soil bulk density for both longitudinal and transversal
settings. The decrease in the transversal signal was smaller than expected. The
wet natural and salinized soils performed very similarly as hypothesized, but
their normalized VICOF response was not significant to bulk density changes.

The measurement of Soil Bulk Density is known to be difficult, especially in field conditions. However, a potential application for field use in the future is the Vibration-Induced Conductivity Fluctuation (VICOF). This method uses AC Electrical Conductivity Measurement with a pair of blade-like electrodes. The soil is exposed to periodic vibration, and the electrodes can be positioned either longitudinally or transversally. The data collected is then used to calculate a normalized index, which provides data independent from vibration strength and reduces the effect of soil salinity and water content.

An experiment was conducted on natural fine sand and salinized fine sand, under two moisture conditions and four bulk densities. The use of blade-shaped electrodes improved electrode-soil contact and reduced measurement noise. Simulations conducted on a simplified resistor lattice found that the transversal effect increases as soil bulk density decreases.

In the measurement of dry sand, a negative correlation was found between normalized conductivity fluctuation and soil bulk density, in both longitudinal and transversal settings. However, the transversal signal was found to decrease less than expected. In wet natural and salinized soils, the performance was very similar, and the normalized VICOF response was not significant to bulk density changes.

"  Although power laws of the Zipf type have been used by many workers to fit
rank distributions in different fields like in economy, geophysics, genetics,
soft-matter, networks etc., these fits usually fail at the tails. Some
distributions have been proposed to solve the problem, but unfortunately they
do not fit at the same time both ending tails. We show that many different data
in rank laws, like in granular materials, codons, author impact in scientific
journal, etc. are very well fitted by a beta-like function. Then we propose
that such universality is due to the fact that a system made from many
subsystems or choices, imply stretched exponential frequency-rank functions
which qualitatively and quantitatively can be fitted with the proposed
beta-like function distribution in the limit of many random variables. We prove
this by transforming the problem into an algebraic one: finding the rank of
successive products of a given set of numbers.

In the realm of physics, there exists a phenomenon involving local charged bosons or local electron pairs, known as Lochons. These Lochons form within a solid state compound called Palladium Deuteride, specifically at special sites or linear channels. The formation of Lochons is attributed to strong electron-phonon interactions or potential inversion on metallic electrodes.

The presence of Lochons catalyzes a unique type of fusion reaction, known as D- - D+ fusion. This fusion process occurs through a mechanism called internal conversion, resulting in the formation of He-4, or bosonic ions. The energy production from this fusion is substantial, with a value of Q=23.8 MeV. This energy is carried by the alpha particle and the ejected electron-pair produced during the fusion process.

In summary, the formation of Lochons within Palladium Deuteride catalyzes D- - D+ fusion, leading to the formation of He-4 and the production of significant energy.

The Boltzmann's Function, a differential equation known for its reciprocal symmetry, has been replaced by the Discrete Finite Difference Equation. This new equation plays a crucial role in unifying bosonic and fermionic distributions.

The Discrete Finite Difference Equation, with its unique symmetry that remains invariant when step 'd' is replaced by '-d', produces solutions in the form of Boson-Fermion pairs. These pairs are the solutions to the Invariant Equation, which is a symmetrized form of the Discrete Finite Difference Equation.

The Reciprocal Symmetric Boltzmann's Function, another representation of the original Boltzmann's Function, also contributes to the unification of bosonic and fermionic distributions.

In 1905, Einstein first derived the mass-energy equivalence principle, introducing a constant denoted as '$C$'. This groundbreaking work was published in Ann. Physik, 17. However, the outcome of this derivation resulted in a zero value for '$C$', which was criticized by Ives. Interestingly, the same paper presented an alternative explanation that made Ives's criticism void, as the zero value for '$C$' was significant in this context. Ives, playing the role of a critic, challenged both the derivation and the constant '$C$'.

"  Since the advent of chirped pulse amplification1 the peak power of lasers has
grown dramatically and opened the new branch of high field science, delivering
the focused irradiance, electric fields of which drive electrons into the
relativistic regime. In a plasma wake wave generated by such a laser,
modulations of the electron density naturally and robustly take the shape of
paraboloidal dense shells, separated by evacuated regions, moving almost at the
speed of light. When we inject another counter-propagating laser pulse, it is
partially reflected from the shells, acting as relativistic flying
(semi-transparent) mirrors, producing an extremely time-compressed
frequency-multiplied pulse which may be focused tightly to the diffraction
limit. This is as if the counterstreaming laser pulse bounces off a
relativistically swung tennis racket, turning the ball of the laser photons
into another ball of coherent X-ray photons but with a form extremely
relativistically compressed to attosecond and zeptosecond levels. Here we
report the first demonstration of the frequency multiplication detected from
the reflection of a weak laser pulse in the region of the wake wave generated
by the driver pulse in helium plasma. This leads to the possibility of very
strong pulse compression and extreme coherent light intensification. This
Relativistic Tennis with photon beams is demonstrated leading to the
possibility toward reaching enormous electromagnetic field intensification and
finally approaching the Schwinger field, toward which the vacuum nonlinearly
warps and eventually breaks, producing electron-positron pairs.

The development of Chirped Pulse Amplification has led to a dramatic growth in the peak power of lasers, opening up a new branch of high field science. This branch of science deals with high-intensity electromagnetic fields, featuring phenomena such as plasma wake waves generated by lasers. These waves in plasma, generated by high-intensity lasers, have a speed almost equal to the speed of light and feature paraboloidal dense shells separated by evacuated regions.

These shells in plasma wake waves, when reflected by laser pulses, create semi-transparent mirrors moving at relativistic speeds, known as relativistic flying mirrors. These mirrors produce time-compressed, frequency-multiplied pulses. This process of increasing the frequency of light, also known as frequency multiplication, can lead to extreme coherent light intensification.

The analogy of photon beams bouncing off these relativistic flying mirrors is known as relativistic tennis. This process produces extremely time-compressed pulses of coherent X-ray photons. The extreme electromagnetic field intensification approached by this process can lead to field intensities at which vacuum nonlinearly warps and breaks, known as the Schwinger field. This results in the production of electron-positron pairs.

"  At the quantization of fields, due to the non-linear character of the time
reversal, the creation-annihilation operators for the negative frequency modes
should be replaced to the operators of antiparticles not directly in the field
operators, but in the operator products. For the standard minimal Lagrangians
(asymmetrical under the complex conjugated fields) it is shown that the charge
conjugation (C-) symmetry conditions for the Hamiltonian and the charge
operator lead to the identities for the operator products allowing one to
replace the negative frequency operator products to the positive frequency
ones. At the same time the operators in observables become normal ordered and
the zero-point energy does not appear. Only the symmetrized under the field
operators Lagrangians lead to the zero-point energy. The confrontation by the

Quantization of fields is a process that requires the replacement of creation-annihilation operators for negative frequency modes. This leads to the formation of identities for operator products and results in the normal ordering of operators in observables. The non-linear character of the time reversal in this process eliminates the zero-point energy, which only appears in symmetrized under the field operators Lagrangians.

The replacement of negative frequency operator products to positive frequency ones is allowed in operator products, which are normally ordered. The operators of antiparticles replace the creation-annihilation operators for negative frequency modes in the operator products.

The charge conjugation (C-) symmetry conditions for the Hamiltonian and the charge operator are discussed in the context of C-symmetric quantization of fields. This quantization method is confronted by experiments, and its discussion includes the solution of vacuum energy problems. The standard minimal Lagrangians, which are asymmetrical under the complex conjugated fields, are the type of Lagrangians used in this context.

The derivation of the time dilation expression involves the use of two light clocks and leads to the development of relativistic spacetime coordinates relations. The method employed is the emission, reflection, and return of light pulses. This derivation results in the concepts of time dilation, Doppler k-factor, addition of velocities, length contraction, Lorentz transformations, and spacetime interval invariance.

These concepts are then incorporated into the relativistic spacetime coordinates relations, which interpret spacetime coordinates in three different inertial frames. To visualize these relations, the Minkowski spacetime diagram is used. This diagram is a visual representation of spacetime coordinates in three different inertial frames and is used to interpret events in terms of spacetime coordinates.

"  We elaborate a theory for the modeling of concepts using the mathematical
structure of quantum mechanics. Concepts are represented by vectors in the
complex Hilbert space of quantum mechanics and membership weights of items are
modeled by quantum weights calculated following the quantum rules. We apply
this theory to model the disjunction of concepts and show that experimental
data of membership weights of items with respect to the disjunction of concepts
can be modeled accurately. It is the quantum effects of interference and
superposition, combined with an effect of context, that are at the origin of
the effects of overextension and underextension observed as deviations from a
classical use of the disjunction. We put forward a graphical explanation of the
effects of overextension and underextension by interpreting the quantum model

The Theory for Modeling Concepts is a powerful tool that accurately models experimental data and represents concepts by vectors in complex Hilbert space. It uses the mathematical structure of Quantum Mechanics, which is known for exhibiting effects such as interference and superposition. These quantum effects combine with context to produce unique results.

One of the key applications of this theory is in modeling the disjunction of concepts. This is where the theory deviates from the classical use of disjunction, exhibiting effects of overextension and underextension. These effects are interpreted through a graphical explanation and are caused by the quantum effects and context.

Quantum Mechanics, the mathematical structure used by the Theory for Modeling Concepts, is not just a passive participant in this process. It actively contributes to the modeling of membership weights of items by quantum weights. This combination of quantum mechanics and context results in the accurate modeling of experimental data, making the Theory for Modeling Concepts a valuable tool in understanding and representing complex concepts.

In the context of evolving and distributed operating environments, organizations have a critical need for advanced frameworks for knowledge management. This is where Knowledge Management Systems come into play, which are based on social relations and collaboration ties. These systems provide the necessary conditions for effective knowledge management.

To better understand and visualize these complex relationships, a Graph Theory Model can be used as a demonstration tool. This model allows for the involvement of actors with the highest betweenness centrality. These actors, who serve as discussion group generators, play a pivotal role in the knowledge management process.

Their involvement facilitates the externalization of tacit knowledge, enabling its preservation and promoting innovation processes. By leveraging these actors, organizations can effectively manage their knowledge life cycle, leading to more effective knowledge management overall.

The recent Hypercomputation Debate has raised new questions about the computational abilities of quantum systems and the role of the Church-Turing Thesis in physics. This debate revolves around the concept of computation as an effective physical process.

In the context of quantum computing, the Bohm and Hiley active information concept has been used to analyze the differences between the standard and non-standard forms of quantum computing. The standard form of quantum computing involves quantum gates, while non-standard forms include adiabatic and morphogenetic types.

The debate also touches on the super-Turing potentialities of quantum computing, which are derived from an incomputable information source and are in accordance with Bell's constraints. These potentialities suggest that quantum oracles could be realized, but this would require giving up the formal concept of ""universality"".

Ultimately, this discussion leads back to the logic of the physical world, as computation is essentially a physical notion.

"  In this paper we first construct a mathematical model for the Universe
expansion that started up with the original Big Bang. Next, we discuss the
problematic of the mechanical and physical laws invariance regarding the
spatial frame exchanges. We then prove the (theoretical) existence of a
variable metric $g_t$, depending on time and satisfying to a simplified
Einstein equation, so that all free ordinary trajectories are geodesics. This
is done by considering the classical Galileo-Newtonian space and time relation,
by using generalized Newtonian principles and adding the approved physical new
ones (as covariance principle, Mach principle, the Einstein equivalence
principle ...) in order to establish a new cosmological model of the dynamical
Universe as being $(U(t))_{t\geq 0}=(B_e(O,t),g_t)_{t\geq 0}$, where $B_e(O,t)$
is the Euclidean ball of radius $t$ in $\mathbb R^3$. The cosmological metric
$g_t$ is totally determined, at time $t$, by the mass energy distribution
$E_t(X)$ on $B_e(O,t)$. We study also the black holes phenomenon and we prove
that the total and global cosmological energy distribution $E_t(X)$ satisfies
to the wave equation whose solutions are characterized by pseudo-frequencies
depending on time and related to the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem on the
unit ball $B_e(O,1)$ for the Laplace-Beltrami operator -$\Delta$. Our model is
consistent in the sense that all Newtonian and classical physical laws are
valid as particular cases in classical situations. Then, we show that all basic
results of Modern Physics are still valid without using the second postulate of
special relativity nor the uncertainty principle.

In the context of the mathematical model for the Universe expansion starting from the original Big Bang, a variable metric $g_t$ is introduced. This metric is time-dependent and satisfies a simplified Einstein equation. The determination of this variable metric is based on the mass energy distribution $E_t(X)$. This distribution also exhibits time dependence and satisfies a wave equation. The pseudo-frequencies associated with this distribution are dependent on time and are related to the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem on the unit ball $B_e(O,1)$ for the Laplace-Beltrami operator -$\Delta$.

The authors of this paper also studied the black holes phenomenon within the framework of this mathematical model. They found that the total and global cosmological energy distribution $E_t(X)$ satisfies a wave equation.

Interestingly, despite the complexities and novel aspects of this model, it is noted that all basic results of Modern Physics remain valid without needing to invoke the second postulate of special relativity or the uncertainty principle.

The concept of 'Weakly Dissipative Free-Surface Flows' is characterized by low levels of energy loss. These flows are modeled using the Classical Potential Flow Approach, which expresses the vortical component in terms of potential and free-surface elevation. The Classical Potential Flow Approach is a simple formulation that does not involve any correction procedure and is applied to the Linearized 3D Navier-Stokes Equations. The treatment of these equations involves Fourier-Laplace Transforms. The Linearized 3D Navier-Stokes Equations are further decomposed using the Helmholtz-Leray Decomposition, leading to the derivation of a Predominant Nonlocal Viscous Term in the Bottom Kinematic Boundary Condition. From the understanding of Weakly Dissipative Free-Surface Flows, the Corresponding Long Wave Model Equations are derived, as referenced in [Joseph2004].

The historical thermodynamic description of gas behavior was initially proposed, but it was incomplete due to the fact that isothermal work was not counted in the internal energy. This description was later adapted to the solid phase, but the issue of isothermal work not being counted in the internal energy persisted, making the description of the solid phase also incomplete.

The internal energy of the solid phase was calculated, and it was found that isothermal work was not counted in it. Additionally, isobaric work was not deducted from the internal energy. The proposed thermodynamic description of solids aimed to address these issues and provided a more complete description of the internal energy of solids. The agreement with theory was good, and the equation of state used was MgO.

However, it is important to note that the Joule postulate, which describes the mechanical equivalency of heat and is considered the first law of thermodynamics, is not applicable to elastic solids. This means that the universality of the Joule postulate is not universal, and it cannot be used to describe the thermodynamic behavior of all solids.

The new understanding of the universe, referred to as 'New 3-Space Dynamics in Cosmology', has been reviewed in the text. This new dynamics is applied to cosmology and has led to the derivation of the Hubble Expansion Solution. It involves the constants G and alpha - the fine structure constant.

Remarkably, this new understanding provides a fit to both supernova data and gamma-ray burst data. It eliminates the need for the concepts of dark energy and dark matter, which have been long-standing mysteries in the field of cosmology.

The new dynamics implies that the age of the universe is approximately 14.7 billion years. It resolves several problems that have been plaguing cosmologists, including the fine tuning and event horizon problems.

Furthermore, it explains phenomena such as the bore hole anomaly, spiral galaxy flat rotation speeds, masses of black holes in spherical galaxies, and gravitational light bending and lensing, all without the need for dark matter or dark energy.

The Quantum Model in Hilbert Space, developed by Aerts (2007a), was designed for the modeling of the combination of concepts. This model represents items and concepts as vectors in Fock space and uses quantum probabilities to model membership weights. This model was further extended into the Quantum Field Theoretic Model in Fock Space.

The Quantum Field Theoretic Model in Fock Space was applied to model the disjunction of concepts and was found to match the results of Hampton's (1988b) experiment. This model is characterized by the presence of quantum effects such as interference and superposition. The origin of overextension and underextension effects observed in the experiment was attributed to deviations from the classical use of disjunction. Items in superpositions of different number states were found to be essential for achieving perfect matches with the experimental data. The model's ability to match predictions with experimental data proved the need for a genuine quantum field theory.

"  H-index, proposed by Hirsch is a good indicator of the impact of a
scientist's research. When evaluating departments, institutions or labs, the
importance of h-index can be further enhanced when properly calibrated for
size. Particularly acute is the issue of federally funded facilities whose
number of actively publishing scientists frequently dwarfs that of academic
departments. Recently Molinari and Molinari developed a methodology that shows
the h-index has a universal growth rate for large numbers of papers, allowing
for meaningful comparisons between institutions.
  An additional challenge when comparing large institutions is that fields have
distinct internal cultures, with different typical rates of publication and
citation; biology is more highly cited than physics, which is more highly cited
than engineering. For this reason, this study has focused on the physical
sciences, engineering, and technology, and has excluded bio-medical research.
Comparisons between individual disciplines are reported here to provide
contextual framework. Generally, it was found that the universal growth rate of
Molinari and Molinari holds well across all the categories considered,
testifying to the robustness of both their growth law and our results.

in 2+1 D. This note catalogs the full family of reaction-free trajectories,
giving a geometrical interpretation by which means the curved path possibility
is easily related to the better known case of hyperbolic motion in 1+1 D.
Motivated by the geometry, it is shown how the catalog of motions can be
naturally extended to include the possibility of lossless reaction-free closed
spatial orbits that turn out to be classical pair creation and destruction
events. The extended theory can accommodate a vacuum plenum of classical
current that could be regarded as a classical version of the Fermionic ZPF of

The concept of a classical point charge in hyperbolic motion is a fascinating one. This motion occurs in a 1+1 D space and time and exhibits reaction-free trajectories. These trajectories are not limited to straight lines but can include curved paths through space. In fact, they extend to lossless reaction-free closed spatial orbits in 2+1 D.

These closed spatial orbits are particularly interesting because they represent classical pair creation and destruction events. This means that particles can be created and destroyed in a reaction-free environment, which is a significant concept in physics.

The theory of a classical point charge in hyperbolic motion is part of a larger extended theory. This extended theory includes the concept of a vacuum plenum of classical current. This is similar to the relationship between the electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF) and stochastic electrodynamics. In essence, the extended theory is a classical version of the fermionic ZPF of quantum field theory (QFT).

"  Author details research on the new, very prospective, electrostatic Space
Elevator climber based on a new electrostatic linear engine previously offered
at the 42nd Joint Propulsion Conference (AIAA-2006-5229) and published in AEAT,
Vol.78, No.6, 2006, pp. 502-508. The electrostatic climber discussed can have
any speed (and braking), the energy for climber movement is delivered by a
lightweight high-voltage line into a Space Elevator-holding cable from Earth
electric generator. This electric line also can be used for delivery electric
energy to a Geosynchronous Space Station. At present, the best solution of the
climber problem (announced by NASA as one important awarding problem of Space
Elevator) is problematic.
  Author also shows the linear electrostatic engine may be used as realistic
power space launcher at the present time. Two projects illustrate these new

In the 43rd Joint Propulsion Conference held in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA from 9-11 July 2007, a paper titled 'AIAA-2007-5838' was presented. This paper was later published in the AEAT, Vol.78, No.6, 2006, pp. 502-508. The paper focused on two main topics: the Electrostatic Space Elevator Climber and the Electrostatic Space Launcher.

The Electrostatic Space Elevator Climber was initially proposed at the 42nd Joint Propulsion Conference. This climber is powered by an Earth electric generator and delivers energy to the Geosynchronous Space Station. However, its current status is problematic. The climber's speed is variable, and it uses a lightweight high-voltage line as its energy source.

On the other hand, the Electrostatic Space Launcher was proposed in the 'AIAA-2007-5838' paper. This launcher is currently considered a realistic power space launcher. The concept of the Electrostatic Space Launcher is illustrated in Project 1 and Project 2.

"  It is conjectured that time intervals of any kind are proportional to the age
of the Universe taken at the time we are considering the interval. If this is
the case then the speed of light, in fact any speed, must decrease inversely
proportional to this age. The immediate consequence is that energy is not
conserved: the hypothesis that time is a homogeneous property implies
conservation of energy (the theorem of Noether). Nonconservation of energy
follows from the condition that any time interval is proportional to the
cosmological time, and therefore time can not be homogeneous. From the
uncertainty principle, taking the constant of Planck as a real constant, time
independent, it follows that any energy in the Universe decreases linearly with
time. We then prove that Schroedinger equation does not change, except for the
potential energy term. The future of the Universe gives for the wave functions
a long sinusoidal spatial solution, so that everything becomes unlocalized. The
relativistic absolute interval remains the same, even with a changing speed of
light, and the Universe turns out to be nonexpanding. A Mass-Boom effect is
confirmed.

According to the conjecture about time intervals, these intervals are proportional to the age of the universe. This principle leads to several implications, one of which is the decrease in the speed of light. The rate of decrease is inversely proportional to the age of the universe.

Another implication is the nonconservation of energy. This is a consequence of time not being a homogeneous property, leading to a violation of Noether's theorem. The energy, in fact, decreases linearly with time, a principle that is based on the uncertainty principle with the constant of Planck.

The wave functions, as a result, become unlocalized, taking the form of long sinusoidal spatial solutions. Despite these changes, the universe remains nonexpanding, maintaining its size despite the changing speed of light.

This conjecture also confirms the mass-boom effect, although the specifics of this effect are not detailed in the provided information.

"  The purpose of this article is to show that the introduction of hidden
variables to describe individual events is fully consistent with the
statistical predictions of quantum theory. We illustrate the validity of this
assertion by discussing two fundamental experiments on correlated photons which
are believed to behave ``violently non-classical''. Our considerations carry
over to correlated pairs of neutral particles of spin one-half in a singlet
state. Much in the spirit of Einstein's conviction we come to the conclusion
that the state vector of a system does not provide an exhaustive description of
the individual physical system. We also briefly discuss an experiment on
``quantum teleportation'' and demonstrate that our completely local approach
leads to a full understanding of the experiment indicating the absence of any
teleportation phenomenon. We caution that the indiscriminated use of the term
``Quantum Theory'' tends to obscure distinct differences between the quantum
mechanics of massive particles and the propagation of photons. It is emphasized
that the properties of polarizers, beam splitters, halfwave plates etc. used in
photon-correlation experiments are defined by the laws of classical optics.
Hence, understanding the outcome of those experiments requires a well-founded
interconnection between classical and quantum electrodynamics free from
unnecessary hypotheses.

The introduction of hidden variables is a concept that aims to show the validity of the assertion that these variables can describe individual events. This concept is consistent with the statistical predictions of quantum theory, which is illustrated by two fundamental experiments: one on correlated photons and another on neutral particles in a singlet state. It's important to note that the indiscriminate use of the term ""Quantum Theory"" can obscure differences between quantum mechanics of massive particles and photon propagation.

The experiment on correlated photons is believed to behave violently non-classical and is discussed in the article to illustrate the validity of the assertion. Similarly, the experiment on neutral particles in a singlet state leads to the conclusion that the state vector of a system does not provide an exhaustive description of the individual physical system. This conclusion is led to by the introduction of hidden variables.

The experiment on quantum teleportation is also discussed in the context of hidden variables. This experiment demonstrates that a completely local approach leads to a full understanding of the experiment, indicating the absence of any teleportation phenomenon.

In the context of quantum theory, it's emphasized that properties of polarizers, beam splitters, halfwave plates etc. used in photon-correlation experiments are defined by the laws of classical optics. Quantum theory requires a well-founded interconnection between classical and quantum electrodynamics.

The Ten Dimensional Unified Field Theory is a complex scientific concept that involves a 4 dimensional Riemannian spacetime and a six dimensional Calabi Yau space structure. This theory provides solutions to supersymmetric Yang Mills fields and black holes.

The supersymmetric Yang Mills fields, one of the solutions, require Bogoliubov transforms in black hole geometries. Black holes, another solution, are known to produce gamma ray bursts and create a spectrum of particles and radiation of dark and normal matter.

There are different types of black holes, including primordial black holes, microscopic black holes, and stellar black holes. These black holes undergo various processes such as formation in the early universe, collapse to singularity, and Hawking evaporation. The Hawking effect of radiating black holes is a notable applicable effect.

Gamma ray bursts, caused by primordial and microscopic black holes, are a result of the intense energy released by these cosmic phenomena. Similarly, the spectrum of particles and radiation of dark and normal matter is also caused by primordial and microscopic black holes.

"  The gravitational phenomenon, founded on the assumption of absorption of a
flux of gravitons through the matter, led to a law of attraction comprising a
term of attenuation of gravity. The attenuation effect, which depends on the
distribution of mass elements into the Sun, was compared with the relativistic
effect for the orbital elements of planets. The calculations carried out with
our modified law of Newton, lead to a perfect agreement for the advance of the
perihelion of planets, and give an interaction cross section with the matter of
3.2x10^-17 m2/kg (approximately 10^-40 cm2/nucleon). The effect of attenuation
during a solar eclipse will produce a local reduction in the soli-lunar
attraction of 0.13 microgal. This small variation of gravity during the eclipse
can lead to distortions of the geoid of about ten millimetres of which effect
on gravity, estimated at a few microgals, is compatible with the observed
gravitational anomalies. The gravimetric measurements taken in the area of
Montreal during the Sun eclipse of May 10, 1994, show the existence of an
anomaly of 2.4 microgals that coincides perfectly with the period of the
eclipse.

The concept of a static gravitational field is characterized by an invariant constraint that links the proper time of an event to a global hypersurface of simultaneity, denoted as t=const. This constraint prevents crossing of a horizon at any finite t.

The proper time of an event is intrinsically connected to this global hypersurface of simultaneity. In stars that exhibit time-like or null geodesics everywhere, the proper times are frozen. This phenomenon, known as gravitational freezing of proper times, is predicted by general relativity. It is maximum but finite at the centre of such stars and nearly freezing near the gravitational radius.

This freezing effect stabilizes contracting massive stars by freezing, a process known as stabilization effect. These stars, often referred to as frozen stars or frozars, can defrost due to emissions and external interactions. Interestingly, internal phase transitions within these stars can initiate refreezing, often accompanied by bursts and explosions.

"  Interest in development of brain prostheses, which might be proposed to
recover mental functions lost due to neuron-degenerative disease or trauma,
requires new methods in molecular engineering and nanotechnology to build
artificial brain tissues. We develop a Dynamic Core model to analyze complexity
of damaged biological neural network as well as transition and recovery of the
system functionality due to changes in the system environment. We provide a
method to model complexity of physical systems which might be proposed as an
artificial tissue or prosthesis. Delocalization of Dynamic Core model is
developed to analyze migration of mental functions in dynamic bio-systems which
undergo architecture transition induced by trauma. Term Dynamic Core is used to
define a set of causally related functions and Delocalization is used to
describe the process of migration. Information geometry and topological
formalisms are proposed to analyze information processes. A holographic model
is proposed to construct dynamic environment with self-poetic Dynamic Core
which preserve functional properties under transition from one host to another.
We found statistical constraints for complex systems which conserve a Dynamic
Core under environment transition. Also we suggest those constraints might
provide recommendations for nanotechnologies and tissue engineering used in
development of an artificial brain tissue.

The development of brain prostheses is a field of interest that requires methods in molecular engineering and nanotechnology. The aim is to recover mental functions lost due to neuron-degenerative disease or trauma. This development involves an interest in creating artificial brain tissues.

The Dynamic Core Model is a set of causally related functions that analyzes the complexity of damaged biological neural networks. It also analyzes the transition and recovery of system functionality, as well as the migration of mental functions in dynamic bio-systems. This model proposes a holographic model and finds statistical constraints for complex systems.

The process of migration, also known as delocalization, describes the movement of mental functions in dynamic bio-systems. Information geometry and topological formalisms are proposed methods for analyzing these information processes.

The holographic model is proposed to construct a dynamic environment with a self-poetic dynamic core. This model aims to preserve functional properties under transition from one host to another. The statistical constraints found for complex systems might provide recommendations for nanotechnologies and tissue engineering. These constraints conserve a dynamic core under environment transition.

The concept of energy packets is a refined way of understanding how energy is transported by electromagnetic waves. This concept is compatible with various theories such as quantum theory, classical electromagnetic wave theory, and special relativity. It is particularly useful in physical problems that involve relativistic effects.

These problems, which often involve free electromagnetic waves, can be solved using the energy packets concept. This approach allows for results that are compatible with simpler energy density definitions in the context of relativistic effects. The energy packets concept is thus a powerful tool that helps to conciliate between different physical approaches.

"  The photon box thought experiment can be considered a forerunner of the
EPR-experiment: by performing suitable measurements on the box it is possible
to ``prepare'' the photon, long after it has escaped, in either of two
complementary states. Consistency requires that the corresponding box
measurements be complementary as well. At first sight it seems, however, that
these measurements can be jointly performed with arbitrary precision: they
pertain to different systems (the center of mass of the box and an internal
clock, respectively). But this is deceptive. As we show by explicit
calculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable,
they develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of
escape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise
way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee
the requirements of complementarity. In addition, our calculations exhibit a
``fine structure'' in the distribution of the uncertainties over the
complementary quantities: depending on \textit{when} the box measurement is
performed, the resulting quantum description of the photon differs. This brings
us close to the argumentation of the later EPR thought experiment.

The Photon Box Thought Experiment is a theoretical construct that allows for the preparation of a photon in complementary states after it escapes. This experiment is a precursor to the EPR-Experiment and shares similar argumentation. However, it's important to note that the measurements involved in this experiment must also be complementary to maintain consistency.

The experiment involves two main systems: the center of mass of the box and an internal clock. When calculated back to the time of the photon's escape, non-vanishing commutators develop. This result justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments and ensures the requirements of complementarity are met.

The quantum description of the photon varies depending on when the box measurement is performed. This dependency on measurement time adds a layer of complexity to the experiment. The fine structure in the distribution of the uncertainties over the complementary quantities also plays a significant role in this experiment.

Despite the fact that measurements can be jointly performed with arbitrary precision, this can create a misleading impression. In reality, the commutators that develop when calculated back to the time of escape of the photon ensure that the measurements are indeed complementary.

NASA made a significant discovery in the field of astrophysics when they claimed the discovery of a Ring of Dark Matter. This discovery was made in the galaxy cluster CL 0024+17 and was supported by gravitational lensing data. The discovery is referenced in Jee M.J. et al. arXiv:0705.2171.

In a separate development, a new theory called New Dynamics of 3-Space has been proposed. This theory explains several astrophysical phenomena and observations, including the Bore Hole Anomaly, the flat rotation speeds of spiral galaxies, the masses of black holes in spherical galaxies, gravitational light bending and lensing, and supernova redshift data. This theory involves the constant G and the Fine Structure Constant (Alpha), but notably does not involve Dark Matter.

"  In this paper, it is shown that the cosmological model that was introduced in
a sequence of three earlier papers under the title, A Dust Universe Solution to
the Dark Energy Problem can be used to analyse and solve the Cosmological
Coincidence Problem. The generic coincidence problem that appears in the
original Einstein universe model is shown to arise from a misunderstanding
about the magnitude of dark energy density and the epoch time governing the
appearance of the integer relation between dark energy and normal energy
density. The solution to the generic case then clearly points to the source of
the time coincidence integer problem in the Friedman dust universe model. It is
then possible to eliminate this coincidence by removing a degeneracy between
different measurement epoch times. In this paper's first appendix, a
fundamental time dependent relation between dark mass and dark energy is
derived with suggestions how this relation could explain cosmological voids and
the clumping of dark mass to become visible matter. In this paper's second
appendix, it is shown that that dark energy is a conserved with time substance
that is everywhere and for all time permeable to the dark mass and visible mass
of which the contracting or expanding universe is composed. The last two
appendices involve detailed studies of cosmology, quantum dark energy related
issues. There are more detailed abstracts given with all four appendices.

This paper, whose title is not provided, introduces a dust universe solution to the dark energy problem. The solution is presented in a series of three papers. One of the main contributions of this paper is the analysis and solution of the cosmological coincidence problem. This problem, which is of a generic type, appears in the original Einstein universe model. The source of the problem is a misunderstanding about the magnitude of dark energy density and epoch time. The solution proposed by this paper is to remove the degeneracy between different measurement epoch times.

The paper also derives a fundamental time-dependent relation between dark mass and dark energy in its first appendix. This relation explains the cosmological voids and the clumping of dark mass to become visible matter. Furthermore, the paper shows in its second appendix that dark energy is a conserved substance. Dark energy is described as being everywhere and for all time permeable, and it composes a contracting or expanding universe. It is permeable to both dark mass and visible matter.

The last two appendices of the paper are dedicated to detailed studies of cosmology and quantum dark energy-related issues. These studies are aimed at understanding the nature of dark energy and its role in the evolution of the universe.

The Cell Method, specifically developed for polyhedral foams, takes into account the bubble geometry of these foams. This method provides for the Generalized Rayleigh-Plesset Equation, which contains a non-local in time term corresponding to heat relaxation. This equation is not only contained within the Cell Method but is also used with the Equations of Mass Balance and Momentum Balances for Effective Single-Phase Inviscid Fluid.

The Generalized Rayleigh-Plesset Equation, along with the other mentioned equations, serves as a model for foam acoustics. This model reconciles the observed sound velocity and attenuation with the predicted, using the assumption that thermal dissipation is the dominant damping mechanism. Indeed, thermal dissipation is the dominant damping mechanism in a range of foam expansions and sound excitation frequencies.

","['\nError 1: \nOriginal: ""relation_to_negative_matter"": \'Repulsion\'\nModified: ""relation_to_negative_matter"": \'Gravitation\'\nExplanation: The original text clearly states that positive matter and negative matter have a relation of repulsion, not gravitation. This change introduces an error because it contradicts the fundamental concept of negative matter as described in the input text. The original text explains that negative matter has a gravitation relation with other negative matter, but a repulsion relation with positive matter. This error significantly alters the meaning of the graph and misrepresents the original content.\n']",1
