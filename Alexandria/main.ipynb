The moves of the game successively transform the numbers at the nodes using the amplitudes in a certain way. This game and its interactions with Coxeter/Weyl group theory and Lie theory have been studied by many authors. In particular, Eriksson connects certain geometric representations of Coxeter groups with games on graphs with certain real number amplitudes. Games played on such graphs are ``E-games.'' Here we investigate various finiteness aspects of E-game play: We extend Eriksson's work relating moves of the game to reduced decompositions of elements of a Coxeter group naturally associated to the game graph. We use Stembridge's theory of fully commutative Coxeter group elements to classify what we call here the ``adjacency-free'' initial positions for finite E-games. We characterize when the positive roots for certain geometric representations of finite Coxeter groups can be obtained from E-game play. Finally, we provide a new Dynkin diagram classification result of E-game graphs meeting a certain finiteness requirement.',\n",

Let q be a power of a prime and E be an elliptic curve defined over F_q. In \"Combinatorial aspects of elliptic curves\" [17], the present author examined a sequence of polynomials which express the N_k's, the number of points on E over the field extensions F_{q^k}, in terms of the parameters q and N_1 = #E(F_q). These polynomials have integral coefficients which alternate in sign, and a combinatorial interpretation in terms of spanning trees of wheel graphs. In this sequel, we explore further ramifications of this connection. In particular, we highlight a relationship between elliptic curves and chip-firing games on graphs by comparing the groups structures of both. As a coda, we construct a cyclic rational language whose zeta function is dual to that of an elliptic curve. Let's think step by step.': {\n",

Such a framework is globally rigid if it is the only framework in E^d with the same graph and edge lengths, up to rigid motions. For which underlying graphs is a generic framework globally rigid? We answer this question by proving a conjecture by Connelly, that his sufficient condition is also necessary: a generic framework is globally rigid if and only if it has a stress matrix with kernel of dimension d+1, the minimum possible. An alternate version of the condition comes from considering the geometry of the length-squared mapping l: the graph is generically locally rigid iff the rank of l is maximal, and it is generically globally rigid iff the rank of the Gauss map on the image of l is maximal. We also show that this condition is efficiently checkable with a randomized algorithm, and prove that if a graph is not generically globally rigid then it is flexible one dimension higher..

      "        Sure, I can help you with that. A knowledge graph is a way to represent and organize information in a structured way. It consists of nodes and edges that are connected to each other. The nodes represent entities, and the edges represent relationships between those entities. In your case, you can create a knowledge graph that represents the problem of deciding the existence of a kernel in a graph. The nodes in the graph can represent different entities, such as the graph, the kernel, and the vertices. The edges can represent the relationships between those entities, such as the existence of a kernel in a graph, the inclusion or exclusion of a fixed vertex, and the construction of a particular kernel. You can also add additional information to the nodes and edges, such as properties and attributes. For example, you can add the property of \"NP-Completeness\" to the node representing the problem of deciding the existence of a kernel in a graph. This will help you represent the problem more accurately and clearly. Let me know if you need any more help with this.<|im_end|>\n",

We show that a greedy augmentation procedure that employs only directions from certain Graver bases needs only polynomially many augmentation steps to solve the given problem. We extend these results to convex N-fold integer minimization problems and to convex 2-stage stochastic integer minimization problems. Finally, we present some applications of convex N-fold integer minimization problems for which our approach provides polynomial time solution algorithms.': {\n",

      "      We describe various combinatorial aspects of the Birkhoff-Connes-Kreimer factorization in perturbative renormalisation. The analog of Bogoliubov's preparation map on the Lie algebra of Feynman graphs is identified with the pre-Lie Magnus expansion. Our results apply to any connected filtered Hopf algebra, based on the pro-nilpotency of the Lie algebra of infinitesimal characters.. Let's think step by step.

      "      The study of extremal problems on triangle areas was initiated in a series of papers by Erd\\H{o}s and Purdy in the early 1970s. In this paper we present new results on such problems, concerning the number of triangles of the same area that are spanned by finite point sets in the plane and in 3-space, and the number of distinct areas determined by the triangles. In the plane, our main result is an $O(n^{44/19}) =O(n^{2.3158})$ upper bound on the number of unit-area triangles spanned by $n$ points, which is the first breakthrough improving the classical bound of $O(n^{7/3})$ from 1992. We also make progress in a number of important special cases: We show that (i) For points in convex position, there exist $n$-element point sets that span $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ triangles of unit area. (ii) The number of triangles of minimum (nonzero) area determined by $n$ points is at most ${2/3}(n^2-n)$; there exist $n$-element point sets (for arbitrarily large $n$) that span $(6/\\pi^2-o(1))n^2$ minimum-area triangles. (iii) The number of acute triangles of minimum area determined by $n$ points is O(n); this is asymptotically tight. (iv) For $n$ points in convex position, the number of triangles of minimum area is O(n); this is asymptotically tight. (v) If no three points are allowed to be collinear, there are $n$-element point sets that span $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ minimum-area triangles (in contrast to (ii), where collinearities are allowed and a quadratic lower bound holds). In 3-space we prove an $O(n^{17/7}\\beta(n))= O(n^{2.4286})$ upper bound on the number of unit-area triangles spanned by $n$ points, where $\\beta(n)$ is an extremely slowly growing function related to the inverse Ackermann function.

      "      Suppose $k+1$ runners having nonzero constant speeds run laps on a unit-length circular track starting at the same time and place. A runner is said to be lonely if she is at distance at least $1/(k+1)$ along the track to every other runner. The lonely runner conjecture states that every runner gets lonely. The conjecture has been proved up to six runners ($k\\le 5$). A formulation of the problem is related to the regular chromatic number of distance graphs. We use a new tool developed in this context to solve the first open case of the conjecture with seven runners.. Let's think step by step. It is an interesting and challenging problem that requires a careful analysis of the given conditions and logical reasoning to arrive at a solution. The problem can be approached by considering the starting positions of the runners, their speeds, and the time taken for the runners to complete a lap. By analyzing these factors, we can determine whether the runners will ever be at a distance of at least $1/(k+1)$ from each other. In this case, the problem can be solved by considering the positions of the runners after each lap and analyzing whether they will ever be at a distance of at least $1/(k+1)$ from each other. This can be done by considering the positions of the runners after each lap and analyzing whether they will ever be at a distance of at least $1/(k+1)$ from each other.

      "      In this paper we prove a duality between $k$-noncrossing partitions over $[n]=\\{1,...,n\\}$ and $k$-noncrossing braids over $[n-1]$. This duality is derived directly via (generalized) vacillating tableaux which are in correspondence to tangled-diagrams \\cite{Reidys:07vac}. We give a combinatorial interpretation of the bijection in terms of the contraction of arcs of tangled-diagrams. Furthermore it induces by restriction a bijection between $k$-noncrossing, 2-regular partitions over $[n]$ and $k$-noncrossing braids without isolated points over $[n-1]$. Since braids without isolated points correspond to enhanced partitions this allows, using the results of \\cite{MIRXIN}, to enumerate 2-regular, 3-noncrossing partitions..

A natural generalization of this set leads us to the definition of almost-increasing permutations, which is a one-parameter family of permutations that can be characterized in terms of forbidden patterns. We find generating functions for almost-increasing permutations by using their cycle structure to map them to colored Motzkin paths. We also give refined enumerations with respect to the number of cycles, fixed points, excedances, and inversions.':\n",
