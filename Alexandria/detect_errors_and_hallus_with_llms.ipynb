    "This code implements a pipeline for deliberately introducing errors into knowledge graphs. \n",
    "Its primary purpose is to create a dataset for evaluating and improving error detection \n",

    "\n",
    "What this code does:\n",
    "1. Loads a dataset containing input texts and their corresponding knowledge graphs.\n",
    "2. For each sample, it uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to introduce a random number \n",
    "   of errors (1-5) into the knowledge graph.\n",
    "3. The LLM also provides detailed explanations for each introduced error.\n",
    "4. The resulting dataset includes the original text, the original knowledge graph, \n",
    "   the corrupted knowledge graph, error explanations, and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "- A dataset containing input texts and their corresponding knowledge graphs.\n",

    "  b. Explanations of the errors\n",
    "  c. The number of errors introduced\n",
    "  d. Processing time for each sample\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases:\n",
    "1. Creating benchmark datasets for testing knowledge graph error detection models.\n",
    "2. Evaluating the robustness of knowledge graph generation systems.\n",
    "3. Training machine learning models to identify and correct errors in knowledge graphs.\n",

The original text states that the knot appears in some transcarbamylases but is absent in homologous proteins of similar structure. Changing this to \"all transcarbamylases and homologous proteins\" misrepresents the original information and eliminates the distinction between the two.\\n\\nError 3: \\nOriginal: \\'suggested_mutation\\': \\'Insertion of a short DNA fragment\\'\\nModified: \\'suggested_mutation\\': \\'Deletion of a short DNA fragment\\'\\nExplanation: This change introduces an error by altering the suggested mutation that could result in the formation of a knotted structure.

Although both terms are related to the study of motion, 'dynamics' refers to the study of the motion of objects under the influence of forces, whereas 'kinetics' refers specifically to the study of the motion of objects without considering the forces that cause the motion. In the context of biopolymer folding, 'dynamics' is the more accurate term, as it encompasses the study of the motion of biopolymers under the influence of various forces.\\n\\nError 2: \\nOriginal: 'Energy minima in the energy landscape'\\nModified: 'Energy maxima in the energy landscape'\\nExplanation: This change introduces an error by replacing 'minima' with 'maxima'. In the context of the energy landscape, 'minima' refers to the lowest energy states, whereas 'maxima' refers to the highest energy states. The original text states that local minima dominate the dynamics of biopolymer folding, indicating that the lowest energy states are the most stable and influential. Replacing 'minima' with 'maxima' would suggest that the highest energy states are the most stable and influential, which is not supported by the original text.\\n\\nError 3: \\nOriginal: 'separates'\\nModified: 'connects'\\nExplanation: This change introduces an error by replacing 'separates' with 'connects'. In the context of the energy landscape, saddle points are said to separate local minima, indicating that they act as barriers or dividers between different energy states. Replacing 'separates' with 'connects' would suggest that saddle points act as bridges or links between different energy states, which is not supported by the original text.\\n\\nError 4: \\nOriginal: 'Biopolymer folding'\\nModified: 'Biopolymer unfolding'\\nExplanation: This change introduces an error by replacing 'folding' with 'unfolding'. In the context of biopolymers, 'folding' refers to the process by which a biopolymer assumes its native structure, whereas 'unfolding' refers to the process by which a biopolymer loses its native structure. The original text discusses the concept of a folding funnel in the context of biopolymer folding, indicating that the focus is on the process of folding.

The original text states that biopolymer folding dynamics are dominated by local minima and saddle points, indicating that these two entities are the primary influencers of the folding process.

The original text states that particles with V<30 km/s were detected, indicating that the particles were moving at velocities less than 30 km/s.

The original text mentions that the bistability curves show crossings that indicate a competition between a Kerr-like effect induced by the polariton population and thermal effects. Replacing thermal effects with quantum effects misrepresents the underlying physics and contradicts the original input text.\\n\\nError 3: \\nOriginal: 'laser_emission': 'Bistable'\\nModified: 'laser_emission': 'Monostable'\\nExplanation: This change introduces an error by replacing bistable laser emission with monostable emission. The original text specifically mentions the observation of polaritonic optical bistability, which implies bistable laser emission. Replacing it with monostable emission contradicts the original input text and misrepresents the experimental results.\\n\\nError 4: \\nOriginal: 'material': 'GaAs'\\nModified: 'material': 'InSb'\\nExplanation: This change introduces an error by replacing the original material (GaAs) with a different material (InSb). The original text specifically mentions the use of GaAs in the microcavity structure. Replacing it with InSb misrepresents the experimental setup and contradicts the original input text.\\n\\nError 5: \\nOriginal: 'regime': 'Strong-coupling'\\nModified: 'regime': 'Weak-coupling'\\nExplanation: This change introduces an error by replacing the strong-coupling regime with a weak-coupling regime. The original text specifically mentions that the observation of polaritonic optical bistability occurs in the strong-coupling regime. Replacing it with a weak-coupling regime misrepresents the underlying physics and contradicts the original input text.\\n\"]\n",

However, in the corrupted graph, this relation has been changed to 'Emission of Photons', which is not mentioned in the original text and contradicts the concept of gravitational phenomena. This change introduces an error by altering the fundamental basis of the gravitational phenomenon.\\n\\nError 2: \\nOriginal: 'Absorption of Gravitons': { 'attributes': { 'effect': 'Attenuation of Gravity' } }\\nModified: 'Absorption of Gravitons': { 'attributes': { 'effect': 'Amplification of Gravity' } }\\nExplanation: The original text states that the absorption of gravitons leads to an attenuation of gravity. However, in the corrupted graph, this attribute has been changed to 'Amplification of Gravity', which is the opposite of the original effect. This change introduces an error by altering the fundamental effect of the absorption of gravitons.\\n\\nError 3: \\nOriginal: 'Solar Eclipse': { 'relations': { 'produces': 'Local Reduction in Soli-Lunar Attraction', ...\\nModified: 'Solar Eclipse': { 'relations': { 'produces': 'Local Increase in Soli-Lunar Attraction', ...\\nExplanation: The original text states that a solar eclipse produces a local reduction in soli-lunar attraction. However, in the corrupted graph, this relation has been changed to 'Local Increase in Soli-Lunar Attraction', which is the opposite of the original effect. This change introduces an error by altering the fundamental effect of a solar eclipse on soli-lunar attraction.\\n\\nError 4: \\nOriginal: 'Solar Eclipse': { 'attributes': { 'reduction_in_soli-lunar_attraction': '0.13 microgal', ...\\nModified: 'Solar Eclipse': { 'attributes': { 'reduction_in_soli-lunar_attraction': '0.13 microgal', ... (under the relation 'produces': 'Local Increase in Soli-Lunar Attraction')\\nExplanation: The original text states that a solar eclipse produces a local reduction in soli-lunar attraction of 0.13 microgal. However, in the corrupted graph, this attribute has been kept under the relation 'produces': 'Local Increase in Soli-Lunar Attraction', which contradicts the original effect. This change introduces an error by keeping an attribute that is no longer consistent with the relation.\\n\\nError 5: \\nOriginal: There are no errors in the 'Gravimetric Measurements in Montreal' section in the original graph.\\nModified: No changes were made to this section in the corrupted graph.\\nExplanation: Although no changes were made to this section, an error could have been introduced by changing the 'anomaly_found' attribute to a value that contradicts the original text.
