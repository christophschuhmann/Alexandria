"  A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather
unexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots
are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein
function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein
Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered
ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most
complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.

This knot is believed to provide protection against unfolding and degradation by the proteasome, and its function is preserved across species and sometimes across kingdoms.

"  Annealed importance sampling is a means to assign equilibrium weights to a
nonequilibrium sample that was generated by a simulated annealing protocol. The
weights may then be used to calculate equilibrium averages, and also serve as
an ``adiabatic signature'' of the chosen cooling schedule. In this paper we
demonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing that
equilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. For
this system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficient
than constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth considering
whenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at the
beginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), as
it is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense.
Furthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.

Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) is a method used for calculating equilibrium averages, serving as an adiabatic signature. This method is compared to Constant Temperature Simulation and is found to be modestly more efficient. AIS is a simple simulated annealing protocol with minimal CPU expense, yet it has the potential for improvement. When applied to a 50-atom Dileucine Peptide, a molecular system, AIS was able to produce equilibrium weights and attain equilibrium distributions with manageable cooling schedules. This implementation of AIS is an example of its practical application in molecular systems.

"  A coarse-grained computational procedure based on the Finite Element Method
is proposed to calculate the normal modes and mechanical response of proteins
and their supramolecular assemblies. Motivated by the elastic network model,
proteins are modeled as homogeneous isotropic elastic solids with volume
defined by their solvent-excluded surface. The discretized Finite Element
representation is obtained using a surface simplification algorithm that
facilitates the generation of models of arbitrary prescribed spatial
resolution. The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant of
T4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Euler
buckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results compare
favorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocks
procedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computational
framework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates
the incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model,
including aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure is
equally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is to
electron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecular

"  Conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the
reorientation of lever-like structures. Using a simple theoretical model, we
show that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is
bendable, e.g. at a localized ""hinge''. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest
with an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the
transition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of ""cargo'' attached to
the lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this
effect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multi-dimensional barrier
crossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices.

In the context of conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes, lever-like structures play a significant role. These structures undergo reorientation during these transitions, and their bendability drastically enhances the transition rate. Interestingly, the optimal flexibility for these structures is found to be intermediate. This intermediate flexibility results in the fastest transition and is least sensitive to the amount of cargo attached to the lever arm.

A simple theoretical model has been used to demonstrate this drastically enhanced transition rate. This model generalizes the Kramers-Langer theory, which was originally applied to multi-dimensional barrier crossing. The theoretical model extends this application to configuration dependent mobility matrices. This generalization provides a more comprehensive understanding of the transition dynamics in macromolecular complexes.

the sliding action of remodeling complex SWI/SNF is characterized through the

The proposed study focuses on both the structural and dynamical properties of nucleosomes. The structural properties are observed to have quantitative changes in DNA complexed length distribution, particularly in H2A Nucleosomes and H2A.Bbd Variant Nucleosomes. On the other hand, the dynamical properties are characterized by the sliding action of the remodeling complex SWI/SNF, which is involved in the evolution of nucleosome position and wrapped DNA length mapping.

The purpose of this study is to determine the DNA complexed length distribution and nucleosome position, with a comparative analysis to biochemical approaches. To achieve this, the study uses methods such as Atomic Force Microscopy and Theoretical Study.

A key aspect of this study is the use of a Linear Energetic Model. This model is employed for the extraction of the net wrapping energy of DNA onto the histone octamer. The model is specifically a Linear Energetic Model for the distribution of DNA complexed length.

"  BACKGROUND: An important question is whether evolution favors properties such
as mutational robustness or evolvability that do not directly benefit any
individual, but can influence the course of future evolution. Functionally
similar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and
capacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of
these differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.
  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution
favors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently
large. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection
pressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that
proteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards
higher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve
greater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both
mutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and
stability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be
quantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral
network.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general
tendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in
highly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute
to the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that
exist in large populations.

The study of evolution and protein properties reveals that evolution favors mutational robustness and evolvability, which benefits the course of future evolution rather than individual proteins. This has been demonstrated through laboratory experiments involving the evolution of cytochrome P450 proteins. Under identical selection pressures and mutation rates, proteins from larger and more polymorphic populations tend to evolve higher mutational robustness and greater stability. This is the first experimental demonstration of evolution favoring mutational robustness and protein stability in highly polymorphic populations. Existing mathematical theories describe this excess mutational robustness and stability as a quantitative relationship between proteins and their occupation of neutral networks. This finding has potential implications for understanding the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria in large populations.

"  Surviving in a diverse environment requires corresponding organism responses.
At the cellular level, such adjustment relies on the transcription factors
(TFs) which must rapidly find their target sequences amidst a vast amount of
non-relevant sequences on DNA molecules. Whether these transcription factors
locate their target sites through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter of
speculation. It has been suggested that the optimum search time is when the
protein equally shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In this
paper, we study the above problem using a Monte Carlo simulation by considering
a very simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number of
low affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites,
corresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip.
We study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations of the two modes
by considering three different types of molecules: a walker that randomly walks
along the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation and
then re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; and
a hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and then
re-associates at a faster rate than the jumper. We analyze the final
probability distribution of molecules for each case and find that TFs can
locate their targets fast enough even if they spend 15% of their search time
diffusing freely in the solution. This indeed agrees with recent experimental
results obtained by Elf et al. 2007 and is in contrast with theoretical
expectation.

In the process of surviving in a diverse environment, organisms require cellular adjustment through transcription factors (TFs). These TFs have the task of finding target sequences among non-relevant sequences on DNA molecules. The search time of TFs is divided between 1D diffusion and 3D diffusion. According to a study in this paper, the optimum search time is achieved by an equal division between these two types of diffusion.

This paper explores the 1D and 3D exploration pathways and combinations of these modes using a Monte Carlo simulation. The study uses a simple physical model with a 1D strip representing DNA. The molecules considered in this study are Walker, Jumper, and Hopper. Walker represents a random walk along the strip with no dissociation. Jumper represents the dissociation and re-association of a TF with the strip at a distant site. Hopper represents dissociation and faster re-association at a distant site.

The findings of this study reveal that TFs can locate targets with just 15% of search time diffusing freely in solution. This contrasts with the theoretical expectation. The paper also references recent experimental results provided by Elf et al. 2007.

simulation. It is found that the trizip2 can fold into its native state through
different zipper pathways, depending on the ways of forming hydrophobic core.
We also find a very fast non-zipper pathway. This indicates that there may be
no inconsistencies in the current pictures of beta-hairpin folding mechanisms.
These pathways occur with different probabilities. zip-out is the most probable
one. This may explain the recent experiment that the turn formation is the
rate-limiting step for beta-hairpin folding.

In a molecular dynamics simulation, 10 successful folding events of trpzip2 were simulated. The outcome of this simulation revealed that trpzip2 can fold into its native state through different zipper pathways, depending on the ways of forming the hydrophobic core. Interestingly, a very fast non-zipper pathway was discovered during this process.

Trpzip2, a peptide, is known to fold into its native state via zipper and non-zipper pathways, with the zip-out pathway being the most probable one. The rate-limiting step in this process is turn formation. The discovery of this very fast non-zipper pathway supports the current understanding of beta-hairpin folding mechanisms, implying that there are no inconsistencies in the current pictures of beta-hairpin folding mechanisms.

The process of separating DNA molecules involves stretching apart complementary strands by force.

"  The time-dependent transverse response of stiff polymers, represented as
weakly-bending wormlike chains (WLCs), is well-understood on the linear level,
where transverse degrees of freedom evolve independently from the longitudinal
ones. We show that, beyond a characteristic time scale, the nonlinear coupling
of transverse and longitudinal motion in an inextensible WLC significantly
weakens the polymer response compared to the widely used linear response
predictions. The corresponding feedback mechanism is rationalized by scaling
arguments and quantified by a multiple scale approach that exploits an inherent
separation of transverse and longitudinal correlation length scales. Crossover
scaling laws and exact analytical and numerical solutions for characteristic
response quantities are derived for different experimentally relevant setups.

Stiff polymers, which are represented as Weakly-bending wormlike chains (WLCs), have a well-understood time-dependent transverse response on the linear level. However, their response significantly weakens beyond a certain time scale due to the nonlinear coupling of transverse and longitudinal motion in an inextensible WLC. This phenomenon is rationalized by scaling arguments and quantified by a multiple scale approach that exploits the inherent separation of correlation length scales. Exact analytical and numerical solutions have been derived for different experimentally relevant setups, leading to the derivation of crossover scaling laws. These findings are applicable to various systems, including cytoskeletal filaments and DNA under tension.

"  We present an exhaustive study of more than 250 ab initio potential energy
surfaces (PESs) of the model dipeptide HCO-L-Ala-NH2. The model chemistries
(MCs) used are constructed as homo- and heterolevels involving possibly
different RHF and MP2 calculations for the geometry and the energy. The basis
sets used belong to a sample of 39 selected representants from Pople's
split-valence families, ranging from the small 3-21G to the large
6-311++G(2df,2pd). The reference PES to which the rest are compared is the
MP2/6-311++G(2df,2pd) homolevel, which, as far as we are aware, is the more
accurate PES of a dipeptide in the literature. The aim of the study presented
is twofold: On the one hand, the evaluation of the influence of polarization
and diffuse functions in the basis set, distinguishing between those placed at
1st-row atoms and those placed at hydrogens, as well as the effect of different
contraction and valence splitting schemes. On the other hand, the investigation
of the heterolevel assumption, which is defined here to be that which states
that heterolevel MCs are more efficient than homolevel MCs. The heterolevel
approximation is very commonly used in the literature, but it is seldom
checked. As far as we know, the only tests for peptides or related systems,
have been performed using a small number of conformers, and this is the first
time that this potentially very economical approximation is tested in full
PESs. In order to achieve these goals, all data sets have been compared and
analyzed in a way which captures the nearness concept in the space of MCs.

This study was the first to test the heterolevel approximation in full PESs.

"  The probability distributions for bending angles in double helical DNA
obtained in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are compared with
theoretical predictions. The computed distributions remarkably agree with the
worm-like chain theory for double helices of one helical turn and longer, and
qualitatively differ from predictions of the semi-elastic chain model. The
computed data exhibit only small anomalies in the apparent flexibility of short
DNA and cannot account for the recently reported AFM data (Wiggins et al,
Nature nanotechnology 1, 137 (2006)). It is possible that the current atomistic
DNA models miss some essential mechanisms of DNA bending on intermediate length
scales. Analysis of bent DNA structures reveals, however, that the bending
motion is structurally heterogeneous and directionally anisotropic on the
intermediate length scales where the experimental anomalies were detected.
These effects are essential for interpretation of the experimental data and
they also can be responsible for the apparent discrepancy.

The study of DNA bending angles has been explored using All-Atom Molecular Dynamics Simulations, which have provided Probability Distributions for DNA Bending Angles. These distributions have been compared with Theoretical Predictions based on the Worm-Like Chain Theory and the Semi-Elastic Chain Model. The results show a good agreement with the Worm-Like Chain Theory, which is applicable to double helices of one helical turn and longer. However, there is a disagreement with the Semi-Elastic Chain Model.

Interestingly, small anomalies in the apparent flexibility of short DNA have been detected. Unfortunately, these simulations are unable to account for the Recently Reported AFM Data, as mentioned in Wiggins et al, Nature nanotechnology 1, 137 (2006). This suggests that Current Atomistic DNA Models might be missing essential mechanisms of DNA bending on intermediate length scales.

The Bent DNA Structures, where experimental anomalies were detected, reveal structurally heterogeneous and directionally anisotropic bending motion on intermediate length scales. This highlights the need for further research to understand the complex behavior of DNA at different scales.

"  BACKGROUND: Many of the mutations accumulated by naturally evolving proteins
are neutral in the sense that they do not significantly alter a protein's
ability to perform its primary biological function. However, new protein
functions evolve when selection begins to favor other, ""promiscuous"" functions
that are incidental to a protein's biological role. If mutations that are
neutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function cause
substantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enable
future functional evolution.
  RESULTS: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how
cytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on
a single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions on
five other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as much
as four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous
activities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely
rationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. The
activities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinated
fashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change
in one function based on the measurement of several others.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can lead
to substantial changes in protein functions that are not currently under
selection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily undergo functional
evolution should selection ""ask new questions"" in the future.

"  The classical approach to protein folding inspired by statistical mechanics
avoids the high dimensional structure of the conformation space by using
effective coordinates. Here we introduce a network approach to capture the
statistical properties of the structure of conformation spaces. Conformations
are represented as nodes of the network, while links are transitions via
elementary rotations around a chemical bond. Self-avoidance of a polypeptide
chain introduces degree correlations in the conformation network, which in turn
lead to energy landscape correlations. Folding can be interpreted as a biased
random walk on the conformation network. We show that the folding pathways
along energy gradients organize themselves into scale free networks, thus
explaining previous observations made via molecular dynamics simulations. We
also show that these energy landscape correlations are essential for recovering
the observed connectivity exponent, which belongs to a different universality
class than that of random energy models. In addition, we predict that the
exponent and therefore the structure of the folding network fundamentally
changes at high temperatures, as verified by our simulations on the AK peptide.

The Network Approach to Protein Folding, introduced by researchers, offers a unique perspective on this complex process. This approach represents conformations as nodes and links them via transitions through elementary rotations around a chemical bond. In doing so, it captures the statistical properties of conformation spaces. This leads to the introduction of degree correlations in the conformation network, which in turn leads to energy landscape correlations. These correlations are essential for recovering the observed connectivity exponent, which belongs to a different universality class than that of random energy models.

The Network Approach interprets folding as a biased random walk on the conformation network. The outcome of this approach is that folding pathways along energy gradients organize themselves into scale-free networks. The structure of the folding network fundamentally changes at high temperatures, a fact that has been verified through simulations using the AK Peptide.

"  A basic question of protein structural studies is to which extent mutations
affect the stability. This question may be addressed starting from sequence
and/or from structure. In proteomics and genomics studies prediction of protein
stability free energy change (DDG) upon single point mutation may also help the
annotation process. The experimental SSG values are affected by uncertainty as
measured by standard deviations. Most of the DDG values are nearly zero (about
32% of the DDG data set ranges from -0.5 to 0.5 Kcal/mol) and both the value
and sign of DDG may be either positive or negative for the same mutation
blurring the relationship among mutations and expected DDG value. In order to
overcome this problem we describe a new predictor that discriminates between 3
mutation classes: destabilizing mutations (DDG<-0.5 Kcal/mol), stabilizing
mutations (DDG>0.5 Kcal/mol) and neutral mutations (-0.5<=DDG<=0.5 Kcal/mol).
In this paper a support vector machine starting from the protein sequence or
structure discriminates between stabilizing, destabilizing and neutral
mutations. We rank all the possible substitutions according to a three state
classification system and show that the overall accuracy of our predictor is as
high as 52% when performed starting from sequence information and 58% when the
protein structure is available, with a mean value correlation coefficient of
0.30 and 0.39, respectively. These values are about 20 points per cent higher
than those of a random predictor.

In the field of proteomics and genomics, protein structural studies have been conducted to understand the extent of mutation effects on stability. These studies approach the problem from both sequence and structure perspectives. One of the key aspects of these studies is the prediction of protein stability free energy change (DDG) upon single point mutation. Interestingly, the distribution of DDG is mostly near zero, with 32% of mutations falling between -0.5 to 0.5 Kcal/mol. However, there is variability in DDG, as it can be positive or negative for the same mutation.

Mutations can be classified into three categories: destabilizing mutations, stabilizing mutations, and neutral mutations. Destabilizing mutations are those where DDG is less than -0.5 Kcal/mol, while stabilizing mutations are those where DDG is greater than 0.5 Kcal/mol. Neutral mutations fall within the range of -0.5 to 0.5 Kcal/mol.

To predict these mutation classes, a Support Vector Machine Predictor is used. This predictor can start from either the protein sequence or structure and can discriminate between stabilizing mutations, destabilizing mutations, and neutral mutations. The predictor has an accuracy of 52% when starting from the sequence and 58% when starting from the structure. The mean value of the correlation coefficient is 0.30 for sequence and 0.39 for structure. This predictor significantly improves over a random predictor by about 20 percentage points.

The study of Nonlinear Conformational Relaxation Dynamics Analysis has been conducted on two classical motor proteins: Motor Protein 1 and Motor Protein 2. This analysis, which is not based on random elastic networks, uses the system of elastic networks and is optimized using Evolutionary Optimization Methods.

The response found from this analysis is well-defined internal mechanical motions, which are triggered by various initial deformations. These motions are robust against external perturbations, making the system reliable even under changing conditions.

The Evolutionary Optimization Methods used in this analysis are specifically designed for creating elastic networks with specific properties. These methods have been used to design special network architectures, which are in turn used in the construction of artificial elastic networks. These special network architectures are also robust against external perturbations.

The artificial elastic networks constructed using these special network architectures operate as cyclic machines and are powered by ligand binding. This construction method ensures that the artificial elastic networks have the desired properties and can function effectively as part of a larger system.

Mechanical forces play a significant role in various biological processes, as they are generated extensively in different parts of cells or tissues. These forces are transduced by force-bearing networks, which are complex and composed of multiple layers. These networks are responsible for transducing mechanical signals that can control and trigger subtle intertwining mechanisms.

The interplay between mechanics and chemistry is crucial in understanding these biological processes. Single molecule methodologies have the capability to unveil these subtle mechanisms by introducing force and studying biological processes. This focus on the interplay between chemistry and mechanics is not only important in single molecule methodologies but is also a necessity in biochemical studies.

"  The equilibrium free energy landscape of an off-lattice model protein as a
function of an internal (reaction) coordinate is reconstructed from
out-of-equilibrium mechanical unfolding manipulations. This task is
accomplished via two independent methods: by employing an extended version of
the Jarzynski equality (EJE) and the protein inherent structures (ISs). In a
range of temperatures around the ``folding transition'' we find a good
quantitative agreement between the free energies obtained via EJE and IS

The equilibrium free energy landscape of an off-lattice model protein was reconstructed using an extended version of Jarzynski equality (EJE) and protein inherent structures (ISs). This reconstruction was made possible by out-of-equilibrium mechanical unfolding manipulations. The internal (reaction) coordinate was studied around the folding transition temperature range.

The EJE and ISs were used in reconstructing the equilibrium free energy landscape and were found to have good quantitative agreement with each other. Both methods were able to reproduce the equilibrium properties of the examined system.

The studied model exhibited structural transitions induced by pulling, which were related to the thermodynamical aspects of folding.

"  In this paper we describe a new technique for the comparison of populations
of DNA strands. Comparison is vital to the study of ecological systems, at both
the micro and macro scales. Existing methods make use of DNA sequencing and
cloning, which can prove costly and time consuming, even with current
sequencing techniques. Our overall objective is to address questions such as:
(i) (Genome detection) Is a known genome sequence present, at least in part, in
an environmental sample? (ii) (Sequence query) Is a specific fragment sequence
present in a sample? (iii) (Similarity discovery) How similar in terms of
sequence content are two unsequenced samples? We propose a method involving
multiple filtering criteria that result in ""pools"" of DNA of high or very high
purity. Because our method is similar in spirit to hashing in computer science,
we call it DNA hash pooling. To illustrate this method, we describe protocols
using pairs of restriction enzymes. The in silico empirical results we present
reflect a sensitivity to experimental error. Our method will normally be
performed as a filtering step prior to sequencing in order to reduce the amount
of sequencing required (generally by a factor of 10 or more). Even as
sequencing becomes cheaper, an order of magnitude remains important.

DNA Hash Pooling is a method that employs multiple filtering criteria to generate pools of DNA with high or very high purity. This process is performed prior to sequencing and is likened to hashing in computer science. The effectiveness of DNA Hash Pooling is noteworthy, as it reduces sequencing by a factor of 10 or more. This method addresses three primary questions: genome detection, sequence query, and similarity discovery.

Genome detection involves determining the presence of a known genome sequence within an environmental sample. This is a presence question that is typically asked within the context of ecological systems. Similarly, a sequence query seeks to identify the presence of a specific fragment sequence within a sample, also within the context of ecological systems.

On the other hand, similarity discovery is a comparison question that seeks to establish the similarity between two unsequenced samples based on their sequence content. This is also within the context of ecological systems.

Sequencing, which is the next step after DNA Hash Pooling, is a costly and time-consuming process, although it is becoming more affordable over time. Restriction enzymes, specifically pairs of them, are used in the DNA Hash Pooling protocol.

Empirical results related to DNA Hash Pooling are available, although they are subject to experimental error. These results are typically obtained through in silico methods.

"  In this work we develop a microscopic physical model of early evolution,
where phenotype,organism life expectancy, is directly related to genotype, the
stability of its proteins in their native conformations which can be determined
exactly in the model. Simulating the model on a computer, we consistently
observe the Big Bang scenario whereby exponential population growth ensues as
soon as favorable sequence-structure combinations (precursors of stable
proteins) are discovered. Upon that, random diversity of the structural space
abruptly collapses into a small set of preferred proteins. We observe that
protein folds remain stable and abundant in the population at time scales much
greater than mutation or organism lifetime, and the distribution of the
lifetimes of dominant folds in a population approximately follows a power law.
The separation of evolutionary time scales between discovery of new folds and
generation of new sequences gives rise to emergence of protein families and
superfamilies whose sizes are power-law distributed, closely matching the same
distributions for real proteins. On the population level we observe emergence
of species, subpopulations which carry similar genomes. Further we present a
simple theory that relates stability of evolving proteins to the sizes of
emerging genomes. Together, these results provide a microscopic first
principles picture of how first gene families developed in the course of early
evolution

In this work, the primary focus is on developing a microscopic physical model of early evolution. This model aims to understand the relationship between an organism's phenotype and genotype, with a particular emphasis on protein stability and sequence-structure combinations. The model was simulated on a computer, where it consistently observed the Big Bang scenario of evolution.

The Big Bang scenario is characterized by exponential population growth, triggered by the discovery of favorable sequence-structure combinations. In this scenario, the computer simulation observed an abrupt collapse of random diversity into a small set of preferred proteins. These proteins, known as dominant folds, remain stable and abundant in the population, with their lifetimes approximately following a power law distribution.

The model also revealed that there is a significant separation between the discovery of new protein folds and the generation of new sequences. This separation is evident on evolutionary time scales. Furthermore, the emergence and sizes of protein families and superfamilies are power-law distributed, closely matching the same distributions for real proteins.

The model also observed the emergence of species on a population level, with each species carrying similar genomes. To relate the stability of evolving proteins to the sizes of emerging genomes, a simple theory was presented in this work. This theory suggests that the stability of proteins is related to the sizes of genomes, providing a new perspective on the evolutionary process.

"  Classical population genetics a priori assigns fitness to alleles without
considering molecular or functional properties of proteins that these alleles
encode. Here we study population dynamics in a model where fitness can be
inferred from physical properties of proteins under a physiological assumption
that loss of stability of any protein encoded by an essential gene confers a
lethal phenotype. Accumulation of mutations in organisms containing Gamma genes
can then be represented as diffusion within the Gamma dimensional hypercube
with adsorbing boundaries which are determined, in each dimension, by loss of a
protein stability and, at higher stability, by lack of protein sequences.
Solving the diffusion equation whose parameters are derived from the data on
point mutations in proteins, we determine a universal distribution of protein
stabilities, in agreement with existing data. The theory provides a fundamental
relation between mutation rate, maximal genome size and thermodynamic response
of proteins to point mutations. It establishes a universal speed limit on rate
of molecular evolution by predicting that populations go extinct (via lethal
mutagenesis) when mutation rate exceeds approximately 6 mutations per essential
part of genome per replication for mesophilic organisms and 1 to 2 mutations
per genome per replication for thermophilic ones. Further, our results suggest
that in absence of error correction, modern RNA viruses and primordial genomes
must necessarily be very short. Several RNA viruses function close to the
evolutionary speed limit while error correction mechanisms used by DNA viruses
and non-mutant strains of bacteria featuring various genome lengths and
mutation rates have brought these organisms universally about 1000 fold below
the natural speed limit.

Classical population genetics takes an a priori approach, assigning fitness to alleles without considering the molecular or functional properties of proteins. However, a study on population dynamics takes a different approach. It involves fitness inference from physical properties of proteins, which is applicable to organisms containing gamma genes. This method is based on a physiological assumption and results in a lethal phenotype when protein stability is lost.

The study assumes that the loss of stability of essential gene-encoded proteins confers a lethal phenotype. It uses the method of diffusion within a gamma dimensional hypercube, which also represents mutation accumulation in organisms. The boundaries of this method are the loss of protein stability and lack of protein sequences. The solution to this is derived from a diffusion equation, which is obtained from point mutations data. The outcome of this study is a universal distribution of protein stabilities, which agrees with existing data.

Furthermore, a theory on mutation rate, maximal genome size, and thermodynamic response establishes a universal speed limit on the rate of molecular evolution. This theory predicts that populations go extinct via lethal mutagenesis when the mutation rate exceeds approximately 6 mutations per essential part of the genome per replication for mesophilic organisms and 1 to 2 mutations per genome per replication for thermophilic ones.

"  Structural fluctuations in the thermal equilibrium of the kinesin motor
domain are studied using a lattice protein model with Go interactions. By means
of the multi-self-overlap ensemble (MSOE) Monte Carlo method and the principal
component analysis (PCA), the free-energy landscape is obtained. It is shown
that kinesins have two subdomains that exhibit partial folding/unfolding at
functionally important regions: one is located around the nucleotide binding
site and the other includes the main microtubule binding site. These subdomains
are consistent with structural variability that was reported recently based on
experimentally-obtained structures. On the other hand, such large structural
fluctuations have not been captured by B-factor or normal mode analyses. Thus,
they are beyond the elastic regime, and it is essential to take into account
chain connectivity for studying the function of kinesins.

The study of structural fluctuations in the kinesin motor domain has been approached using a Lattice Protein Model with Go Interactions. This model was essential in capturing the intricate details of the kinesin structure, which is crucial for understanding its function, given the importance of chain connectivity in kinesin function.

The analysis of these structural fluctuations was conducted using two methods: the Multi-Self-Overlap Ensemble (MSOE) Monte Carlo Method and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). These methods allowed for a comprehensive examination of the kinesin motor domain's structural variability.

The kinesin motor domain was found to have two subdomains, located at the nucleotide binding site and the main microtubule binding site. The structural variability observed in these subdomains was consistent with experimentally-obtained structures, demonstrating the reliability of the model and analysis methods used.

It's worth noting that traditional methods such as B-factor or Normal Mode Analyses have failed to capture these large structural fluctuations in the kinesin motor domain, highlighting the necessity of the more complex methods used in this study.

"  A coarse-grained variational model is used to investigate the polymer
dynamics of barrier crossing for a diverse set of two-state folding proteins.
The model gives reliable folding rate predictions provided excluded volume
terms that induce minor structural cooperativity are included in the
interaction potential. In general, the cooperative folding routes have sharper
interfaces between folded and unfolded regions of the folding nucleus and
higher free energy barriers. The calculated free energy barriers are strongly
correlated with native topology as characterized by contact order. Increasing
the rigidity of the folding nucleus changes the local structure of the
transition state ensemble non-uniformly across the set of protein studied.
Neverthless, the calculated prefactors k0 are found to be relatively uniform
across the protein set, with variation in 1/k0 less than a factor of five. This
direct calculation justifies the common assumption that the prefactor is
roughly the same for all small two-state folding proteins. Using the barrier
heights obtained from the model and the best fit monomer relaxation time 30ns,
we find that 1/k0 (1-5)us (with average 1/k0 4us). This model can be extended
to study subtle aspects of folding such as the variation of the folding rate
with stability or solvent viscosity, and the onset of downhill folding.

The study of the Polymer Dynamics of Barrier Crossing in a diverse set of two-state folding proteins was conducted using a Coarse-grained Variational Model. This model provides reliable predictions for the Folding Rate, which varies with stability or solvent viscosity. The model includes Excluded Volume Terms in its interaction potential, which induces minor structural cooperativity. This enhances the reliability of the folding rate predictions.

The Coarse-grained Variational Model was found to induce cooperative folding routes with characteristics such as sharper interfaces and higher free energy barriers. The prefactor k0 was found to vary less than a factor of five across the protein set, justifying the common assumption that the prefactor is roughly the same for all small two-state folding proteins. The best fit monomer relaxation time was found to be 30ns, with 1/k0 duration ranging from 1-5us, with an average of 4us.

The Polymer Dynamics of Barrier Crossing is characterized by Contact Order. The free energy barriers are strongly correlated with native topology, which is also characterized by Contact Order. The calculated free energy barriers are influenced by the cooperative folding routes and are characterized by sharper interfaces between folded and unfolded regions, leading to higher free energy barriers.

The Native Topology influences the free energy barriers and is correlated with the calculated free energy barriers. The Transition State Ensemble was found to change its local structure with increasing rigidity of the folding nucleus, with non-uniform changes across the set of proteins studied.

"  In this paper we present a novel framework for sequence to shape maps. These
combinatorial maps realize exponentially many shapes, and have preimages which
contain extended connected subgraphs of diameter n (neutral networks). We prove
that all basic properties of RNA folding maps also hold for combinatorial maps.
Our construction is as follows: suppose we are given a graph $H$ over the $\{1
>...,n\}$ and an alphabet of nucleotides together with a symmetric relation
$\mathcal{R}$, implied by base pairing rules. Then the shape of a sequence of
length n is the maximal H subgraph in which all pairs of nucleotides incident
to H-edges satisfy $\mathcal{R}$. Our main result is to prove the existence of
at least $\sqrt{2}^{n-1}$ shapes with extended neutral networks, i.e. shapes
that have a preimage with diameter $n$ and a connected component of size at
least $(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})^n+(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})^n$. Furthermore, we show
that there exists a certain subset of shapes which carries a natural graph
structure. In this graph any two shapes are connected by a path of shapes with
respective neutral networks of distance one. We finally discuss our results and
provide a comparison with RNA folding maps.

The main result of this novel framework for sequence to shape maps is the proof of the existence of at least $\sqrt{2}^{n-1}$ shapes with extended neutral networks. These shapes form a subset that carries a natural graph structure, where each shape is connected by paths of shapes with respective neutral networks of distance one. This subset is a part of the exponentially many shapes realized by the novel framework.

The extended neutral networks are extended connected subgraphs of diameter n, with a connected component of size at least $(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})^n+(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})^n$. These subgraphs are contained in the preimages of the exponentially many shapes.

The novel framework proves the basic properties of RNA folding maps and applies them to combinatorial maps. The properties of RNA folding maps are compared with those of the novel framework. The main result of the novel framework is the proof of the existence of at least $\sqrt{2}^{n-1}$ shapes with extended neutral networks.

"  We introduce a topology-based nonlinear network model of protein dynamics
with the aim of investigating the interplay of spatial disorder and
nonlinearity. We show that spontaneous localization of energy occurs
generically and is a site-dependent process. Localized modes of nonlinear
origin form spontaneously in the stiffest parts of the structure and display
site-dependent activation energies. Our results provide a straightforward way
for understanding the recently discovered link between protein local stiffness
and enzymatic activity. They strongly suggest that nonlinear phenomena may play
an important role in enzyme function, allowing for energy storage during the

In the context of the Structure-based Model of Ubiquitin, Hydrodynamic Interactions play a significant role. These interactions are incorporated into the model and have notable effects on the behavior of the protein. For instance, they may reduce the peak force when the protein is being stretched at a constant speed. This effect is particularly pronounced at larger speeds.

Furthermore, Hydrodynamic Interactions facilitate the unfolding of the protein when subjected to constant force. However, they also inhibit the stretching of the protein by fluid flows. This demonstrates the complex interplay of forces in the model and how they influence the protein's behavior.

"  The influence of three well-known disaccharides, namely trehalose, maltose
and sucrose, on some structural and dynamical properties of lysozyme has been
investigated by means of molecular dynamics computer simulations in the 37-60
wt % concentration range. The effects of sugars on the protein conformation are
found relatively weak, in agreement with the preferential hydration of
lysozyme. Conversely, sugars seem to increase significantly the relaxation
times of the protein. These effects are shown to be correlated to the
fractional solvent accessibilities of lysozyme residues and further support the
slaving of protein dynamics. Moreover, a significant increase in the relaxation
times of lysozyme, sugars and water molecules is observed within the studied
concentration range and may result from the percolation of the hydrogen-bond
network of sugar molecules. This percolation appears to be of primary
importance to explain the influence of sugars on the dynamical properties of
lysozyme and water.

This increase in relaxation times was of primary importance in explaining the influence of sugars on the dynamical properties of lysozyme and water. The possible cause of this increase was attributed to the percolation of the hydrogen-bond network of sugar molecules.

"  Initial reaction rate data for lactic dehydrogenase / pyruvate, lactic

irradiation of the crystalline substrates prior to dissolution and
incorporation in the reaction solutions. These energies, presumably, correspond

presumed photoproduct is consumed stoichiometrically with the pyruvate
substrate. These findings are consistent with the proposition that the observed

This reaction was associated with the Time-specific Irradiation of Crystalline Substrates, which occurred before the Dissolution and Incorporation in Reaction Solutions. The estimated irradiation energy requirement for this reaction was 10% of 546 nm, 400 footcandles for 5 seconds. The reaction rate increase mechanism for this reaction was Photoproducts from Oscillatory Atmospheric Gas Reactions, and the photoproduct consumption was stoichiometric with the Pyruvate Substrate.

The Lactic Dehydrogenase / Lactate Reaction had an activation free energy change of -195 cal/mole. Like the Lactic Dehydrogenase / Pyruvate Reaction, this reaction was also associated with the Time-specific Irradiation of Crystalline Substrates, which caused conformational or vibrational changes in the reactants or activated complex.

"  In 1968, Sorin Comorosan first reported a phenomenon wherein irradiation of
the substrate of an enzyme reaction, in the crystalline state, for a specific
number of seconds could lead to an enhanced aqueous solution reaction rate for
the enzyme(up to 30%). Dependence on crystal irradiation time was found to be
oscillatory with a fixed period. The basis for this unusual phenomenon has
remained a mystery. Previously unreported experimental results are presented
which demonstrate, for the LDH / pyruvate reaction, that the identity of the
crystalline material irradiated is, largely, inconsequential. It is proposed
here that the irradiation procedure drives oscillatory reactions involving
atmospheric gases adsorbed on the crystals and that these photoproducts, or
related dark-reaction species, when dissolved, function as enzyme cofactors.

In 1968, a scientist named Sorin Comorosan made a remarkable discovery: the irradiation-induced enhancement of enzyme reaction rate. This phenomenon occurred in the crystalline state of enzyme substrate and resulted in an enhanced aqueous solution reaction rate, with the rate of enhancement reaching up to 30%. Interestingly, the basis for this phenomenon remained a mystery.

The LDH/pyruvate reaction was used to demonstrate the results of this discovery. It was found that the identity of the crystalline material irradiated was inconsequential. The experimental results were previously unreported and a proposed mechanism for this phenomenon was oscillatory reactions involving atmospheric gases adsorbed on the crystals. The function of the photoproducts in this process was identified as enzyme cofactors.

"  We demonstrate a new algorithm for finding protein conformations that
minimize a non-bonded energy function. The new algorithm, called the difference
map, seeks to find an atomic configuration that is simultaneously in two
constraint spaces. The first constraint space is the space of atomic
configurations that have a valid peptide geometry, while the second is the
space of configurations that have a non-bonded energy below a given target.
These two constraint spaces are used to define a deterministic dynamical
system, whose fixed points produce atomic configurations in the intersection of
the two constraint spaces. The rate at which the difference map produces low
energy protein conformations is compared with that of a contemporary search
algorithm, parallel tempering. The results indicate the difference map finds
low energy protein conformations at a significantly higher rate then parallel
tempering.

The new algorithm for protein conformations, named Difference Map, is designed to find atomic configurations in two constraint spaces. This algorithm significantly outperforms the contemporary search algorithm, Parallel Tempering. The Difference Map minimizes the non-bonded energy function, which is an energy function for atomic configurations. It operates in two constraint spaces, namely, valid peptide geometry and non-bonded energy below a target value. These constraint spaces are defined by a deterministic dynamical system, which also produces atomic configurations. The fixed points of this system are the atomic configurations in the intersection of the two constraint spaces.

"  Fifteen years ago, a structural analysis of the hormone insulin and the
retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) revealed that they may physically
interact with one another. Subsequently, an RB peptide corresponding to the
proposed RB binding site for insulin was found to recognize full-length insulin
in vitro. As part of efforts aimed at developing this RB peptide into an
anti-cancer drug, this molecule was chemically coupled to a cellular
internalization signal and termed ""MCR peptide"". Meanwhile, several such MCR
peptide variants have been demonstrated to restrain the proliferation of
different human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, one of the MCR
peptides coined MCR-10 was shown to be capable of interfering with the complex
formation between insulin and RB in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, as monitored by
immunofluorescence. This latter result indicating an in vivo association
between insulin and RB was confirmed by a follow-up study combining the methods
of co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Here, we provide evidence for the
existence of the insulin-RB complex in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer
cells. Specifically, we demonstrate this heterodimer by means of a magnetic
beads-based immunoprecipitation approach and equally show that this dimer can
be disrupted by MCR-4 or MCR-10 each of which is known to possess
antiproliferative properties, yet to a much lesser extent by a control peptide.
Thus, this investigation has yielded another important proof for the occurrence
of the insulin-RB dimer and, furthermore, its validity as a target for
antineoplastic MCR peptides.

In the theoretical studies of protein stretching, a coarse-grained model was used to examine the behavior of 20 proteins with knots. The focus of this study was on the behavior of the knot ends. Interestingly, it was found that the knot ends in these proteins jump to defined locations, unlike the behavior observed in homopolymers.

The 20 proteins with knots, which were the subject of this study, displayed the unique behavior of their knot ends jumping to defined locations. This behavior was found to be associated with sharp turns, contrasting with the diffusive behavior observed in homopolymers.

The behavior of the knot ends was observed to be dependent on temperature. The waiting times for these movements were found to be increasingly stochastic. Furthermore, it was noted that larger knots do not return to their native locations.

"  A simple lattice model, recently introduced as a generalization of the

of the model proteins, together with their energy landscape, are studied on the
basis of the exact solution of the model. Afterwards, the kinetic response of
the molecules to a force is considered, discussing both force clamp and dynamic
loading protocols and showing that theoretical expectations are verified. The

The Simple Lattice Model, a recently introduced model, is a generalization of the Wako--Saito Model. Both models are used to investigate the properties of widely studied molecules under external forces, with a specific application in protein folding. The properties under investigation include equilibrium properties and the energy landscape of model proteins, which are studied using the exact solution of the model.

In the context of the kinetic response of molecules to a force, two protocols are discussed: force clamp and dynamic loading. Theoretical expectations regarding these protocols have been verified.

Protein unfolding is another area of interest, where kinetic parameters are evaluated using computer simulations. The results of these simulations show nice agreement with experimental results.

The free energy landscape of proteins is investigated using the Extended Jarzynski Equality. This investigation is carried out through pulling experiments.

"  In this paper we present the asymptotic enumeration of RNA structures with
pseudoknots. We develop a general framework for the computation of exponential
growth rate and the sub exponential factors for $k$-noncrossing RNA structures.
Our results are based on the generating function for the number of
$k$-noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structures, ${\sf S}_k(n)$, derived in
\cite{Reidys:07pseu}, where $k-1$ denotes the maximal size of sets of mutually
intersecting bonds. We prove a functional equation for the generating function
$\sum_{n\ge 0}{\sf S}_k(n)z^n$ and obtain for $k=2$ and $k=3$ the analytic
continuation and singular expansions, respectively. It is implicit in our
results that for arbitrary $k$ singular expansions exist and via transfer
theorems of analytic combinatorics we obtain asymptotic expression for the
coefficients. We explicitly derive the asymptotic expressions for 2- and
3-noncrossing RNA structures. Our main result is the derivation of the formula
${\sf S}_3(n) \sim \frac{10.4724\cdot 4!}{n(n-1)...(n-4)}

"  It previously has been discovered that visible light irradiation of
crystalline substrates can lead to enhancement of subsequent enzymatic reaction
rates as sharply peaked oscillatory functions of irradiation time. The
particular activating irradiation times can vary with source of a given enzyme
and thus, presumably, its molecular structure. The experiments reported here
demonstrate that the potential for this anomalous enzyme reaction rate
enhancement can be transferred from one bacterial species to another coincident
with transfer of the genetic determinant for the relevant enzyme. In
particular, the effect of crystal-irradiated chloramphenicol on growth of
bacterial strains in which a transferable R-factor DNA plasmid coding for
chloramphenicol resistance was or was not present (S. panama R+, E. coli R+,
and E. coli R-) was determined. Chloramphenicol samples irradiated 10, 35 and
60 sec produced increased growth rates (diminished inhibition) for the
resistant S. panama and E. coli strains, while having no such effect on growth
rate of the sensitive E. coli strain. Consistent with past findings,
chloramphenicol samples irradiated 5, 30 and 55 sec produced decreased growth
rates (increased inhibition) for all three strains.

Visible light irradiation of crystalline substrates leads to an enhancement of enzymatic reaction rates, which is influenced by the source of the enzyme and the molecular structure. This enhancement results in sharply peaked oscillatory functions of irradiation time. Interestingly, this enzymatic reaction rate enhancement can be transferred from one bacterial species to another, coinciding with the transfer of the genetic determinant for the relevant enzyme. This anomalous potential is indeed transferable.

In the case of crystal-irradiated chloramphenicol, it affects the growth of various bacterial strains. Specifically, S. panama R+ and E. coli R+, which have a transferable plasmid coding for chloramphenicol resistance, experienced increased growth rates (diminished inhibition) after irradiation for 10, 35, and 60 seconds. This is consistent with past findings of decreased growth rates (increased inhibition) in these strains. However, for E. coli R-, which does not have a transferable plasmid coding for chloramphenicol resistance, there was no effect on growth rate after irradiation.

The Inherent Structure Theory plays a significant role in discovering strong connections between the simple characteristics of protein structure and the energy landscape of a Go model. This theory is crucial for models of protein dynamics and thermodynamics.

The Go model, a model used in inherent structure theory, is employed to study protein dynamics and thermodynamics. The energy landscape of this model is highly correlated with the potential energies and vibrational free energies of inherent structures. These energies are simple measures of networks of native contacts.

"  We study the passage times of a translocating polymer of length $N$ in three
dimensions, while it is pulled through a narrow pore with a constant force $F$
applied to one end of the polymer. At small to moderate forces, satisfying the
condition $FN^{\nu}/k_BT\lesssim1$, where $\nu\approx0.588$ is the Flory
exponent for the polymer, we find that $\tau_N$, the mean time the polymer
takes to leave the pore, scales as $N^{2+\nu}$ independent of $F$, in agreement
with our earlier result for F=0. At strong forces, i.e., for
$FN^{\nu}/k_BT\gg1$, the behaviour of the passage time crosses over to
$\tau_N\sim N^2/F$. We show here that these behaviours stem from the polymer
dynamics at the immediate vicinity of the pore -- in particular, the memory
effects in the polymer chain tension imbalance across the pore.

In a study on polymer translocation, researchers examined the behavior of a polymer with length $N$ in three dimensions, as it was pulled through a narrow pore with a constant force $F$ applied to one end of the polymer.

Under small to moderate force conditions, where $FN^{\nu}/k_BT\lesssim1$ and the Flory exponent $\nu\approx0.588$, the mean passage time of the polymer was found to scale as $\tau_N\sim N^{2+\nu}$, and was independent of the applied force $F$. This result was in agreement with earlier findings for the case where no force was applied ($F=0$).

However, under strong force conditions, where $FN^{\nu}/k_BT\gg1$, the mean passage time of the polymer scaled as $\tau_N\sim N^2/F$. The observed behaviors were attributed to the specific dynamics of the polymer at the immediate vicinity of the pore, including memory effects in the polymer chain tension imbalance across the pore.

"  Experimental variables of optical tweezers instrumentation that affect RNA
folding/unfolding kinetics were investigated. A model RNA hairpin, P5ab, was
attached to two micron-sized beads through hybrid RNA/DNA handles; one bead was
trapped by dual-beam lasers and the other was held by a micropipette. Several
experimental variables were changed while measuring the unfolding/refolding
kinetics, including handle lengths, trap stiffness, and modes of force applied
to the molecule. In constant-force mode where the tension applied to the RNA
was maintained through feedback control, the measured rate coefficients varied
within 40% when the handle lengths were changed by 10 fold (1.1 to 10.2 Kbp);
they increased by two- to three-fold when the trap stiffness was lowered to one
third (from 0.1 to 0.035 pN/nm). In the passive mode, without feedback control
and where the force applied to the RNA varied in response to the end-to-end
distance change of the tether, the RNA hopped between a high-force folded-state
and a low-force unfolded-state. In this mode, the rates increased up to
two-fold with longer handles or softer traps. Overall, the measured rates
remained with the same order-of-magnitude over the wide range of conditions
studied. In the companion paper (1), we analyze how the measured kinetics
parameters differ from the intrinsic molecular rates of the RNA, and thus how
to obtain the molecular rates.

In the investigation of optical tweezers instrumentation, the effect on RNA folding/unfolding kinetics was studied using the P5ab RNA Hairpin model. The experiment involved attaching two micron-sized beads to the P5ab RNA Hairpin through hybrid RNA/DNA handles. One bead was trapped by dual-beam lasers, while the other was held by a micropipette.

The experimental variables that were investigated included handle lengths, trap stiffness, and force modes. The handle lengths were varied by a factor of 10, ranging from 1.1 to 10.2 Kbp. The trap stiffness was also varied, ranging from 0.1 to 0.035 pN/nm. The force modes used were constant-force mode and passive mode.

In the constant-force mode, the tension applied to the RNA was maintained through feedback control. The handle lengths were varied by 10 fold, resulting in a variation in kinetics within 40%. When the trap stiffness was lowered to one third, the kinetics increased by two- to three-fold.

On the other hand, the passive mode did not involve feedback control. In this mode, the force applied to the RNA varied in response to the end-to-end distance change of the tether. The kinetics increased up to two-fold with longer handles or softer traps.

"  By exerting mechanical force it is possible to unfold/refold RNA molecules
one at a time. In a small range of forces, an RNA molecule can hop between the
folded and the unfolded state with force-dependent kinetic rates. Here, we
introduce a mesoscopic model to analyze the hopping kinetics of RNA hairpins in
an optical tweezers setup. The model includes different elements of the
experimental setup (beads, handles and RNA sequence) and limitations of the
instrument (time lag of the force-feedback mechanism and finite bandwidth of
data acquisition). We investigated the influence of the instrument on the
measured hopping rates. Results from the model are in good agreement with the
experiments reported in the companion article (1). The comparison between
theory and experiments allowed us to infer the values of the intrinsic
molecular rates of the RNA hairpin alone and to search for the optimal
experimental conditions to do the measurements. We conclude that long handles

In the realm of analyzing hopping kinetics of RNA hairpins, a process called exerting mechanical force is employed. This involves applying force to RNA molecules, which allows for the unfolding and refolding of these molecules. As a result, force-dependent hopping kinetics are observed, where the RNA molecules hop between their folded and unfolded states. This process is typically carried out in an optical tweezers setup.

An optical tweezers setup is designed to analyze the hopping kinetics of RNA hairpins. It includes beads, handles, and an RNA sequence. However, it does have its limitations, such as a time lag in the force-feedback mechanism and a finite bandwidth of data acquisition. Despite these limitations, the setup has proven to be effective in its purpose.

In this setup, a mesoscopic model is often used. This model is not only applicable to optical tweezers setups but also to other experimental setups and molecules. Its function is to analyze hopping kinetics, and it has been found to yield results that are in good agreement with experiments.

The intrinsic molecular rates, which are extracted from experiments, play a crucial role in this analysis. These rates are inferred from a comparison of theory and experiments. It has been found that the optimal conditions for extracting these rates include using long handles and soft laser traps.

A companion article, though the year is not specified, reports on experiments related to the hopping kinetics of RNA hairpins. This article provides further insights into the topic.

"  Using a time-dependent perturbation theory, vibrational energy relaxation
(VER) of isotopically labeled amide I modes in cytochrome c solvated with water

from the protein and water. The VER pathways are visualized using radial and
angular excitation functions for resonant normal modes. Key differences of VER
among different amide I modes are demonstrated, leading to a detailed picture

The investigation of Vibrational Energy Relaxation (VER) was conducted using Time-dependent Perturbation Theory. This study was focused on the Isotopically Labeled Amide I Modes in Cytochrome C Solvated with Water. The methodology involved the decomposition of contributions to VER from both the protein and water components.

The visualization of this process was achieved through Radial and Angular Excitation Functions for Resonant Normal Modes. The findings of this investigation provided a detailed picture of the spatial anisotropy of VER. This was supported by the experimental observation of sub picosecond timescales for Amide I modes in proteins.

Furthermore, the relaxation mechanism was found to be sensitive to the environment of the Amide I mode. In the case of the Isotopically Labeled Amide I Modes in Cytochrome C Solvated with Water, the relaxation timescale was found to be on the sub picosecond level, and the environment sensitivity was noted to be significant.

Surface modified amorphous nanoporous silica, derived from volcanic soil, has been developed using a top-down approach. This material has been long used as a feed additive in the poultry industry and is considered safe for human consumption by the WHO and USDA. It has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties, making it a versatile substance.

The top-down approach, which utilizes volcanic soil derived silica, is specifically used for developing amorphous nanoporous silica. This type of silica is known for its ability to mediate the physical absorption of VLDL, serum triglycerides, and other serum cholesterol components. This process occurs through physical absorption in lipophilic nanopores, which ultimately reduces the supply of host-derived cholesterol.

One of the significant uses of this material is in combating chicken malaria in the poultry industry. The amorphous nanoporous silica limits the growth of the malarial parasite in vivo by reducing the supply of host-derived cholesterol. This mechanism of action makes it an effective tool in managing this disease.

"  Malaria and other parasites, including virus often induce an increase in host
lipids which the invaders use to their own advantage. We obtained encouraging
results in our investigations on bird malaria with a new approach namely the
use of nanosilica to mop up excess host lipids. While this project is
continuing we have investigated another, simpler system namely silkworms which
suffer from a deadly baculovirus, BmNPV. This virus decimates the infected
population within 24 hours or so and no known antibiotic antidote or
genetically resistant strain of silkworm3 exists. We report here a partial
success, which is worth following up. Our rationale, we believe, has a broad
and interdisciplinary appeal, for, this nanosilica treatment might be used
together with other arsenals on all sorts of virus which take advantage of
enhanced host lipids. It has not escaped our notice that Ebola and HIV also
belong to this category. Nanoparticles are being preferentially harnessed,
because they offer a greater surface area, circulate more easily and in
lepidopteran system4 they are removed within 24 hours from the body. Lawry
surmised, on cogent theoretical grounds that particles significantly smaller
than micron order would be less harmful in the hemocoele. Furthermore, Hui-peng
et al. pointed out that lipase treatment, the only viable option for
controlling BmNPV interferes in hormonal balance and cannot be applied to pre

In the realm of medical research, scientists have been investigating the use of nanosilica treatment to combat bird malaria. This approach involves using nanosilica to mop up excess host lipids, a strategy that has yielded encouraging results. Nanosilica treatment is considered a better alternative to lipase treatment, which interferes with hormonal balance and cannot be applied during the pre-molting stage.

The benefits of nanosilica treatment are manifold. It has a greater surface area, which allows for easier circulation and quick removal from the body. Moreover, it is less harmful to the hemocoele. Beyond bird malaria, nanosilica treatment has potential uses in treating other diseases that induce an increase in host lipids, such as Ebola and HIV.

In another application, nanosilica treatment has been used to combat the BmNPV virus, which decimates infected populations of silkworms within 24 hours. There is currently no known antidote or genetically resistant strain against this virus. Despite the dire consequences of infection, lipase treatment remains the only viable option for controlling BmNPV, underscoring the need for continued research into alternative treatments like nanosilica.

In the realm of insect pests, various types of surface functionalized nanosilica have been employed as a method of control. These nanosilica particles, typically sized between 50-60 nm, are equipped with inner pores ranging from 3-10 nm. They work by sucking up cuticular lipids and breaking the water barrier, effectively killing the insect pests.

In a different application, nanosilica has been used to control host lipids induced by the malarial parasite, P. gallinaceum, in poultry birds. The use of nanosilica in this context has been shown to bring VLDL cholesterol and serum triglycerides back to normal levels, thereby checking the growth of the parasite.

On a related note, the silkworm (Bombyx mori) has been decimated by the baculovirus, NPV, for which no antidote is currently known. This virus enhances host lipids, further exacerbating the problem. However, nanosilica AL60102 and AL60106 have shown the most marked effect on infected silkworms, suggesting their potential as prophylactic and pharmaceutical agents. Interestingly, normal larvae treated with these nanosilica variants survive up to the cocoon formation stage.

effectively used as therapeutic drug for combating trypanosomiasis. The
amorphous nanosilica was developed by top-down approach using volcanic soil
derived silica (Advasan; 50- 60 nm size with 3-10 nm inner pore size range) and
diatomaceous earth (FS; 60-80 nm size with 3-5 nm inner pore size range) as
source materials. According to WHO and USDA standards amorphous silica has long
been used as feed additives for several veterinary industries and considered to
be safe for human consumption. The basic mechanism of action of these
nanosilica molecules is mediated by the physical absorption of HDL components
in the lipophilic nanopores of nanosilica. This reduces the supply of the host
derived cholesterol, thus limiting the growth of the Trypanosoma sp. in vivo.

Trypanosomiasis, a disease affecting wild animals, pets, zoo animals, and mammals of veterinary importance, is caused by Trypanosoma sp. Currently, the treatment for this disease involves drugs with serious side effects. However, there is potential for a new therapy using surface modified amorphous nanoporous silica molecules.

These surface modified amorphous nanoporous silica molecules are considered safe for human consumption and have a size range of 50-80 nm with inner pore sizes ranging from 3-10 nm.

These molecules are derived from two sources: volcanic soil derived silica (Advasan) and diatomaceous earth (FS). Both sources have been approved by the WHO and USDA.

Volcanic soil derived silica (Advasan) has a size of 50-60 nm with inner pore sizes of 3-10 nm, while diatomaceous earth (FS) has a size of 60-80 nm with inner pore sizes of 3-5 nm. The use of these surface modified amorphous nanoporous silica molecules could potentially provide a safer and more effective treatment for trypanosomiasis.

"  Proteins are known to locate their specific targets on DNA up to two orders
of magnitude faster than predicted by the Smoluchowski three-dimensional
diffusion rate. One of the mechanisms proposed to resolve this discrepancy is
termed ""intersegment transfer"". Many proteins have two DNA binding sites and
can transfer from one DNA segment to another without dissociation to water. We
calculate the target search rate for such proteins in a dense globular DNA,
taking into account intersegment transfer working in conjunction with DNA
motion and protein sliding along DNA. We show that intersegment transfer plays
a very important role in cases where the protein spends most of its time
adsorbed on DNA.

","[""\nError 1: \nOriginal: 'Biopolymer Folding Dynamics'\nModified: 'Biopolymer Folding Kinetics'\nExplanation: This change introduces an error by replacing 'dynamics' with 'kinetics'. Although both terms are related to the study of motion, 'dynamics' refers to the study of the motion of objects under the influence of forces, whereas 'kinetics' refers specifically to the study of the motion of objects without considering the forces that cause the motion. In the context of biopolymer folding, 'dynamics' is the more accurate term, as it encompasses the study of the motion of biopolymers under the influence of various forces.\n\nError 2: \nOriginal: 'Energy minima in the energy landscape'\nModified: 'Energy maxima in the energy landscape'\nExplanation: This change introduces an error by replacing 'minima' with 'maxima'. In the context of the energy landscape, 'minima' refers to the lowest energy states, whereas 'maxima' refers to the highest energy states. The original text states that local minima dominate the dynamics of biopolymer folding, indicating that the lowest energy states are the most stable and influential. Replacing 'minima' with 'maxima' would suggest that the highest energy states are the most stable and influential, which is not supported by the original text.\n\nError 3: \nOriginal: 'separates'\nModified: 'connects'\nExplanation: This change introduces an error by replacing 'separates' with 'connects'. In the context of the energy landscape, saddle points are said to separate local minima, indicating that they act as barriers or dividers between different energy states. Replacing 'separates' with 'connects' would suggest that saddle points act as bridges or links between different energy states, which is not supported by the original text.\n\nError 4: \nOriginal: 'Biopolymer folding'\nModified: 'Biopolymer unfolding'\nExplanation: This change introduces an error by replacing 'folding' with 'unfolding'. In the context of biopolymers, 'folding' refers to the process by which a biopolymer assumes its native structure, whereas 'unfolding' refers to the process by which a biopolymer loses its native structure. The original text discusses the concept of a folding funnel in the context of biopolymer folding, indicating that the focus is on the process of folding. Replacing 'folding' with 'unfolding' would suggest that the focus is on the process of unfolding, which is not supported by the original text.\n\nError 5: \nOriginal: 'Local Minima and Saddle Points'\nModified: No change, but an error could be introduced by adding another unrelated entity to the relation, e.g. 'Local Minima and Saddle Points and Protein Structure'\nExplanation: This error introduces an unrelated entity to the relation, which alters the meaning of the original text. The original text states that biopolymer folding dynamics are dominated by local minima and saddle points, indicating that these two entities are the primary influencers of the folding process. Adding another unrelated entity, such as protein structure, would suggest that this entity also plays a dominant role in the folding process, which is not supported by the original text.\n""]",5

suppressor retinoblastoma protein (RB). Since related signatures had previously
been identified also in insulin and the two insulin-like growth factors (IGFs),
the aim of the current study has been to investigate whether further hints

additional similarities are presented supporting the notion of an insulin

The Insulin Superfamily is a group of growth-promoting proteins that are characterized by their dual localization and tropism for Retinoblastoma Protein. This family includes Human Transferrin, Growth Hormone (GH), Insulin, and Insulin-like Growth Factors (IGFs). These proteins are found in both the extracellular environment and intracellular space.

Interestingly, these proteins harbor a Viral Oncoprotein Binding Motif, a pattern identical to that found in viral oncoproteins. This motif allows these proteins to bind to the Retinoblastoma Protein, a tumor suppressor primarily located in the nucleus. The binding of these proteins to the Retinoblastoma Protein is a key aspect of their function, as it allows them to regulate cell growth and division.

The Elastic Ribbon Model is a significant tool used to capture the stiffness properties of polymers or polymer bundles. This model accounts for both twist stiffness and asymmetric bending stiffness. When applied to a Thermally Fluctuating Ribbon, the effects of the model become more pronounced. The Ring Geometry, acting as a geometric constraint, induces effects on the Thermally Fluctuating Ribbon. These effects include bend-bend coupling and twist-bend coupling, which ultimately increase the Effective Bending Stiffness of the polymer.

In the context of experimental investigations of polymer bundles, the Mean Square Diameter has been proposed as a parameter. This parameter is determined in the semiflexible limit and has been affirmed by Monte Carlo Simulations. These simulations affirm the predictions of the Elastic Ribbon Model, even up to high flexibility.

The Magnetic Tweezers Investigation studied the mechanical response of Single Chromatin Fibers. The study showed transient trapping of positive turns at a rate of one turn per nucleosome. The energy of this transition was found to be less than 8 kT. The physiological relevance of this transition was proposed to be breaking the docking of the dimers on the tetramer.

Single Chromatin Fibers were subjected to large positive torsion, leading to a nucleosome chiral transition to a metastable form. This metastable form was based on a righthanded tetrasome. This transition was found to be relevant and served to break the docking of the dimers on the tetramer. This block against the elongation of transcription by the main RNA polymerase.

"  In this study we evaluate, at full atomic detail, the folding processes of
two small helical proteins, the B domain of protein A and the Villin headpiece.
Folding kinetics are studied by performing a large number of ab initio Monte
Carlo folding simulations using a single transferable all-atom potential. Using
these trajectories, we examine the relaxation behavior, secondary structure
formation, and transition-state ensembles (TSEs) of the two proteins and
compare our results with experimental data and previous computational studies.
To obtain a detailed structural information on the folding dynamics viewed as
an ensemble process, we perform a clustering analysis procedure based on graph
theory. Moreover, rigorous pfold analysis is used to obtain representative
samples of the TSEs and a good quantitative agreement between experimental and
simulated Fi-values is obtained for protein A. Fi-values for Villin are also
obtained and left as predictions to be tested by future experiments. Our
analysis shows that two-helix hairpin is a common partially stable structural
motif that gets formed prior to entering the TSE in the studied proteins. These
results together with our earlier study of Engrailed Homeodomain and recent
experimental studies provide a comprehensive, atomic-level picture of folding
mechanics of three-helix bundle proteins.

The results of the simulations were compared with both experimental data and previous computational studies. The B domain of protein A showed good quantitative agreement with the experimental data, with Fi-values obtained through pfold analysis. Similarly, the Villin headpiece also had Fi-values derived from pfold analysis, which could serve as predictions for future experiments.

The stability of the branching structure of an RNA molecule is a crucial condition for its function. The melting thermodynamics of RNA molecules are sensitive to the branching geometry of these molecules. This has been described using the Go model, with a case study involving a molecule with Cayley Tree branching geometry.

In the case of RNA molecules with linear geometry, the melting process is a conventional continuous phase transition, and the critical exponents are classical. However, for RNA molecules with Cayley Tree geometry, the free energy is smooth within precision, with a mathematical singularity at the stability limit of the ordered structure. Interestingly, the correlation length diverges on the high-temperature side of this singularity.

"  RNA polymerase (RNAP) is an enzyme that synthesizes a messenger RNA (mRNA)
strand which is complementary to a single-stranded DNA template. From the
perspective of physicists, an RNAP is a molecular motor that utilizes chemical
energy input to move along the track formed by a DNA. In many circumstances,
which are described in this paper, a large number of RNAPs move simultaneously
along the same track; we refer to such collective movements of the RNAPs as
RNAP traffic. Here we develop a theoretical model for RNAP traffic by
incorporating the steric interactions between RNAPs as well as the
mechano-chemical cycle of individual RNAPs during the elongation of the mRNA.
By a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we calculate the rates
of mRNA synthesis and the average density profile of the RNAPs on the DNA
track. We also introduce, and compute, two new measures of fluctuations in the
synthesis of RNA. Analyzing these fluctuations, we show how the level of {\it
intrinsic noise} in mRNA synthesis depends on the concentrations of the RNAPs
as well as on those of some of the reactants and the products of the enzymatic
reactions catalyzed by RNAP. We suggest appropriate experimental systems and
techniques for testing our theoretical predictions.

RNA Polymerase (RNAP) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in synthesizing messenger RNA (mRNA) strands complementary to single-stranded DNA templates. From a physicist's perspective, RNAP is considered a molecular motor that utilizes chemical energy input to move along the track formed by a DNA molecule. In the context of RNAP traffic, RNAPs participate in collective movements along the same DNA track.

A theoretical model has been developed to understand RNAP traffic better. This model incorporates steric interactions between RNAPs and the mechano-chemical cycle of individual RNAPs during mRNA elongation. The model has been used to calculate rates of mRNA synthesis and average density profiles of RNAPs on the DNA track. It also measures fluctuations, such as intrinsic noise in mRNA synthesis and its dependence on the concentrations of RNAPs and reactants/products of enzymatic reactions catalyzed by RNAP.

The model suggests appropriate experimental systems and techniques for testing these theoretical predictions. These experimental systems and techniques are essential for validating the model and gaining a deeper understanding of RNAP traffic.

"  Strong experimental and theoretical evidence shows that transcription factors
and other specific DNA-binding proteins find their sites using a two-mode
search: alternating between 3D diffusion through the cell and 1D sliding along
the DNA. We consider the role spatial effects in the mechanism on two different
scales. First, we reconcile recent experimental findings by showing that the 3D
diffusion of the transcription factor is often local, i.e. the transcription
factor lands quite near its dissociation site. Second, we discriminate between
two types of searches: global searches and local searches. We show that these
searches differ significantly in average search time and the variability of
search time. Using experimentally measured parameter values, we also show that
1D and 3D search is not optimally balanced, leading to much larger estimates of
search time. Together, these results lead to a number of biological
implications including suggestions of how prokaryotes and eukaryotes achieve
rapid gene regulation and the relationship between the search mechanism and

The search mechanism employed by transcription factors and DNA-binding proteins is a two-mode process that alternates between 3D diffusion through the cell and 1D sliding along the DNA. This process is considered on two different spatial scales. The 3D diffusion of transcription factors is often local, meaning the transcription factor lands quite near its dissociation site. This mechanism leads to significant differences in average search time and the variability of search time. It's important to note that the 1D and 3D search is not optimally balanced, leading to much larger estimates of search time.

Recent experimental findings about the 3D diffusion of the transcription factor have been reconciled by this search mechanism. The mechanism also discriminates between two types of searches: global and local searches. The implications of this search mechanism are far-reaching, affecting prokaryotes and eukaryotes gene regulation, as well as the relationship between the search mechanism and noise in gene expression. The evidence supporting these findings is strong, both experimentally and theoretically.

The Brownian Inchworm Model is a significant model that is used to understand the propulsion mechanisms of various entities. It models the Self-propelled Elastic Dimer, which operates in the absence of an external potential. The propulsion mechanism of this model is formed by Nonequilibrium Noise and Stretch-dependent Damping.

One of the key attributes of the Brownian Inchworm Model is that it exhibits position-velocity correlations. It also has a nonzero mean internal force and a drift velocity. The model is known for its analytical results, which include striking current reversals. These results compare very well with numerical simulations.

The Brownian Inchworm Model is not just limited to one type of entity. It unifies the propulsion mechanisms of various entities, including DNA Helicases, Polar Rods on a Vibrated Surface, Crawling Keratocytes, and Myosin VI. This makes the Brownian Inchworm Model a versatile tool for understanding the propulsion mechanisms of different entities in the absence of an external potential.

"  Thermal shape fluctuations of grafted microtubules were studied using high
resolution particle tracking of attached fluorescent beads. First mode
relaxation times were extracted from the mean square displacement in the
transverse coordinate. For microtubules shorter than 10 um, the relaxation
times were found to follow an L^2 dependence instead of L^4 as expected from
the standard wormlike chain model. This length dependence is shown to result
from a complex length dependence of the bending stiffness which can be
understood as a result of the molecular architecture of microtubules. For
microtubules shorter than 5 um, high drag coefficients indicate contributions
from internal friction to the fluctuation dynamics.

In the study titled 'Thermal Shape Fluctuations of Grafted Microtubules Study', the focus was on the First Mode Relaxation Times. These times were studied using High Resolution Particle Tracking of Attached Fluorescent Beads, and the extraction method used was Mean Square Displacement in the Transverse Coordinate. Interestingly, the First Mode Relaxation Times observed in Microtubules deviated from the expected results of the Standard Wormlike Chain Model.

The deviation was due to the complex length dependence of the bending stiffness, which is a result of the molecular architecture of Microtubules. The length dependence was found to be L^2 for Microtubules shorter than 10 um, whereas the expected length dependence was L^4. The internal friction of Microtubules also contributed to their fluctuation dynamics. It's worth noting that Microtubules with lengths less than 10 um showed this L^2 dependence, and those less than 5 um had high drag coefficients.

The process of protein binding to specific DNA sites has been studied in a model DNA by a single protein. The study was comparative and quantitative in nature, focusing on the efficiency of different search mechanisms. These mechanisms include sliding, inter-segmental hoppings, and detachment/re-attachments. The efficiency of these mechanisms was compared to determine the most effective method.

The study introduced new efficiency measures, deemed as a relevant quantity, to better understand the process. These measures were experimentally measured through in-vitro experiments. The results provide valuable insights into the protein binding process, which is crucial for DNA metabolism.

E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is an enzyme that undergoes conformational transitions between the closed state (CS) and the occluded state (OS). The active site of this enzyme can be closed or occluded by the Met20 loop. A sequence-based approach identified a network of residues, known as the allostery wiring diagram, which facilitates the motion of the Met20 loop. This enzyme's kinetics were monitored using a self-organized polymer model, which observed the sliding motion of the Met20 loop during the CS->OS transition and the reverse transition. The Met20 loop is responsible for transmitting allosteric signals during the CS->OS transition.

"  This work is concerned with the development of a well-founded, theoretically
justified, and least complicated metric for the classification of proteins with
reference to enzymes. As the signature of an enzyme family, a catalytic domain
is easily fingerprinted. Given that the classification problem has so far
seemed intractable, a classification schema derived from the catalytic domain
would be satisfying. Here I show that there exists a natural ab initio if
nonobvious basis to theorize that the catalytic domain of an enzyme is uniquely
informative about its regulation. This annotates its function. Based on this
hypothesis, a method that correctly classifies potassium ion channels into
their respective subfamilies is described. To put the principle on firmer
ground, extra validation was sought and obtained through co-evolutionary
analyses. The co-evolutionary analyses reveal a departure from the notion that
potassium ion channel proteins are functionally modular. This finding is
discussed in light of the prevailing notion of domain. These studies establish
that significant co-evolution of the catalytic domain of a gene with its
conjoint domain is a specialized, necessary process following fusion and
swapping events in evolution. Instances of this discovery are likely to be
found pervasive in protein science.

The focus of this work is on developing a metric for protein classification, specifically for enzymes. The proposed basis for this metric is the theorizing of the unique informativeness of the catalytic domain. This domain is used as a signature for the enzyme family and is uniquely informative about the regulation and function of enzymes.

The method described for classifying potassium ion channels seeks validation through co-evolutionary analyses. This validation source reveals a departure from the notion of functional modularity in potassium ion channel proteins. The co-evolutionary analyses establish that the co-evolution of the catalytic domain is necessary after fusion and swapping events. This finding suggests that there is significant co-evolution of the catalytic domain with the conjoint domain.

The goal of this work is to create a well-founded, theoretically justified, and simple metric. The method outcome is the correct classification of potassium ion channels. This process is a specialized, necessary evolutionary process with the implication that pervasive instances are expected in protein science.

The review paper focused on Probabilistic Regulatory Networks (PRN), introducing the concept of Homomorphisms of PRN. The paper applied the Probabilistic Boolean Network model and utilized Markov Chains as a technique. The paper's context was the application of PRN to the immune system.

Probabilistic Regulatory Networks are networks with probabilistic functions, specifically two functions. They are associated with the immune system and are analyzed using Markov Chains. The Probabilistic Boolean Network, a Boolean model for PRN, was applied to the immune system, specifically for modeling B/T-cells interaction. The equilibrium state of this interaction was determined using Markov Chains.

"  We study how the dynamic equilibrium of the reversible protein-protein
binding network in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to large changes in
abundances of individual proteins. The magnitude of shifts between free and
bound concentrations of their immediate and more distant neighbors in the
network is influenced by such factors as the network topology, the distribution
of protein concentrations among its nodes, and the average binding strength.
Our primary conclusion is that, on average, the effects of a perturbation are
strongly localized and exponentially decay with the network distance away from
the perturbed node, which explains why, despite globally connected topology,
individual functional modules in such networks are able to operate fairly
independently. We also found that under specific favorable conditions, realized
in a significant number of paths in the yeast network, concentration
perturbations can selectively propagate over considerable network distances (up
to four steps). Such ""action-at-a-distance"" requires high concentrations of
heterodimers along the path as well as low free (unbound) concentration of
intermediate proteins.

The study on yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae focuses on the dynamic equilibrium of the reversible protein-protein binding network. This network is influenced by factors such as network topology, protein concentration distribution, and average binding strength. The perturbation of individual proteins within this network was investigated, revealing that the effects of such perturbations are strongly localized and exponentially decay with network distance. This means that the impact of a change in one protein is mostly felt by its immediate neighbors, with the effect diminishing as you move further away in the network.

However, under specific favorable conditions, concentration perturbations can selectively propagate over considerable network distances. These conditions include high concentrations of heterodimers and low free concentration of intermediate proteins. The dynamic equilibrium of this network impacts the free and bound concentrations of immediate and distant neighbors. Therefore, any changes in this equilibrium can have a significant effect on the overall protein-protein binding network in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

"  A model is presented to describe the nucleotide and repeat addition
processivity by the telomerase. In the model, the processive nucleotide
addition is implemented on the basis of two requirements: One is that stem IV
loop stimulates the chemical reaction of nucleotide incorporation, and the
other one is the existence of an ssRNA-binding site adjacent to the polymerase
site that has a high affinity for the unpaired base of the template. The
unpairing of DNA:RNA hybrid after the incorporation of the nucleotide paired
with the last base on the template, which is the prerequisite for repeat
addition processivity, is caused by a force acting on the primer. The force is
resulted from the unfolding of stem III pseudoknot that is induced by the
swinging of stem IV loop towards the nucleotide-bound polymerase site. Based on
the model, the dynamics of processive nucleotide and repeat additions by
Tetrahymena telomerase are quantitatively studied, which give good explanations
to the previous experimental results. Moreover, some predictions are presented.
In particular, it is predicted that the repeat addition processivity is mainly
determined by the difference between the free energy required to disrupt the
DNA:RNA hybrid and that required to unfold the stem III pseudoknot, with the
large difference corresponding to a low repeat addition processivity while the
small one corresponding to a high repeat addition processivity.

The Telomerase Nucleotide and Repeat Addition Processivity Model describes two key processes: Processive Nucleotide Addition and Repeat Addition Processivity. The model is based on Stem IV Loop Stimulation, Unpaired Base Affinity, and Force on Primer. It predicts that Repeat Addition Processivity is determined by the Free Energy Difference.

Processive Nucleotide Addition is a process of nucleotide incorporation that requires Stem IV Loop Stimulation and Unpaired Base Affinity. The Stem IV Loop stimulates the chemical reaction of nucleotide incorporation, while there is a high affinity for the unpaired base adjacent to the polymerase site.

Repeat Addition Processivity, on the other hand, is the process of unpairing the DNA:RNA hybrid. This process is caused by a force on the primer, which originates from the unfolding of the Stem III Pseudoknot. The Stem IV Loop moves towards the nucleotide-bound polymerase site during this process.

The model predicts that the Repeat Addition Processivity is determined by the Free Energy Difference. A large difference results in low Repeat Addition Processivity, while a small difference results in high Repeat Addition Processivity.

"  With the continued improvement of sequencing technologies, the prospect of
genome-based medicine is now at the forefront of scientific research. To
realize this potential, however, we need a revolutionary sequencing method for
the cost-effective and rapid interrogation of individual genomes. This
capability is likely to be provided by a physical approach to probing DNA at
the single nucleotide level. This is in sharp contrast to current techniques
and instruments which probe, through chemical elongation, electrophoresis, and
optical detection, length differences and terminating bases of strands of DNA.
In this Colloquium we review several physical approaches to DNA detection that
have the potential to deliver fast and low-cost sequencing. Center-fold to
these approaches is the concept of nanochannels or nanopores which allow for
the spatial confinement of DNA molecules. In addition to their possible impact
in medicine and biology, the methods offer ideal test beds to study open
scientific issues and challenges in the relatively unexplored area at the
interface between solids, liquids, and biomolecules at the nanometer length
scale. We emphasize the physics behind these methods and ideas, critically
describe their advantages and drawbacks, and discuss future research
opportunities in this field.

Genome-based medicine is at the forefront of scientific research, offering the potential for cost-effective and rapid interrogation of individual genomes. However, this requires a revolutionary sequencing method that contrasts with current techniques and instruments.

Current techniques and instruments probe the length differences and terminating bases of strands of DNA using methods such as chemical elongation, electrophoresis, and optical detection. In contrast, a physical approach to probing DNA is likely to provide the revolutionary sequencing method needed for genome-based medicine.

This physical approach includes the concept of nanochannels or nanopores, which allow for the spatial confinement of DNA molecules. The use of nanochannels or nanopores opens up research opportunities in the relatively unexplored area of the interface between solids, liquids, and biomolecules at the nanometer length scale. This approach has the potential to impact not only medicine but also biology.

Additionally, nucleotides labeled i and i+j cannot form a bond if j equals 1 or 2. The number of these structures is denoted by S_{k,3}(n).

The main result of this study is the derivation of the formula for S_{3,3}(n), which is approximately (6.11170*4!)/(n*(n-1)...(n-4)) * 4.54920^n. This formula gives us the exponential growth factors for arbitrary k >= 3. Furthermore, a subexponential factor has been derived specifically for k=3.

"  We consider a general incompressible finite model protein of size M in its
environment, which we represent by a semiflexible copolymer consisting of amino
acid residues classified into only two species (H and P, see text) following
Lau and Dill. We allow various interactions between chemically unbonded
residues in a given sequence and the solvent (water), and exactly enumerate the
number of conformations W(E) as a function of the energy E on an infinite
lattice under two different conditions: (i) we allow conformations that are
restricted to be compact (known as Hamilton walk conformations), and (ii) we
allow unrestricted conformations that can also be non-compact. It is easily
demonstrated using plausible arguments that our model does not possess any
energy gap even though it is supposed to exhibit a sharp folding transition in
the thermodynamic limit. The enumeration allows us to investigate exactly the
effects of energetics on the native state(s), and the effect of small size on
protein thermodynamics and, in particular, on the differences between the
microcanonical and canonical ensembles. We find that the canonical entropy is
much larger than the microcanonical entropy for finite systems. We investigate
the property of self-averaging and conclude that small proteins do not
self-average. We also present results that (i) provide some understanding of
the energy landscape, and (ii) shed light on the free energy landscape at
different temperatures.

The Incompressible Finite Model Protein, based on Lau and Dill, is a model of size M in a semiflexible copolymer environment, composed of amino acid residues. The residue species in this model are H and P. This model allows for various interactions, compact conformations in the form of Hamilton Walk Conformations, and unrestricted, non-compact conformations. It also exhibits a sharp folding transition.

The model investigates the effects of energetics, protein thermodynamics, and both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. It enumerates the number of conformations W(E), which depends on energy E, in an infinite lattice environment. The microcanonical ensemble, which has much smaller entropy than the canonical ensemble, and the canonical ensemble itself, with much larger entropy, are both investigated by this model.

The Basic Enzyme-Catalysed Reaction is a type of chemical reaction that is catalysed by an enzyme. This reaction is unique because it has a Periodically Varying Substrate Input Rate. This means that the rate at which the substrate is input into the reaction varies in a periodic pattern over time.

For this reaction, there is a Necessary and Sufficient Condition for Periodic Solution Existence. This condition is a mathematical condition that applies specifically to the Basic Enzyme-Catalysed Reaction. The proof for this condition uses the Leray-Schauder Degree and Homotopy, which are both mathematical concepts.

The Leray-Schauder Degree is a mathematical concept that is used in the proof. It is applied to the Homotopy, which is another mathematical concept that is constructed for the proof. The Homotopy is a continuous deformation of one function to another, which is a key concept in the proof.

The Proof Using Leray-Schauder Degree and Homotopy employs the Leray-Schauder Degree and constructs the Homotopy. This proof is used to demonstrate the Necessary and Sufficient Condition for Periodic Solution Existence in the Basic Enzyme-Catalysed Reaction.

"  The determination of a patient's DNA sequence can, in principle, reveal an
increased risk to fall ill with particular diseases [1,2] and help to design
""personalized medicine"" [3]. Moreover, statistical studies and comparison of
genomes [4] of a large number of individuals are crucial for the analysis of
mutations [5] and hereditary diseases, paving the way to preventive medicine
[6]. DNA sequencing is, however, currently still a vastly time-consuming and
very expensive task [4], consisting of pre-processing steps, the actual
sequencing using the Sanger method, and post-processing in the form of data
analysis [7]. Here we propose a new approach that relies on functionalized
nanopore-embedded electrodes to achieve an unambiguous distinction of the four
nucleic acid bases in the DNA sequencing process. This represents a significant
improvement over previously studied designs [8,9] which cannot reliably
distinguish all four bases of DNA. The transport properties of the setup
investigated by us, employing state-of-the-art density functional theory
together with the non-equilibrium Green's Function method, leads to current
responses that differ by at least one order of magnitude for different bases
and can thus provide a much more robust read-out of the base sequence. The
implementation of our proposed setup could thus lead to a viable protocol for
rapid DNA sequencing with significant consequences for the future of genome
related research in particular and health care in general.

DNA sequencing, the process of determining the precise order of nucleotides within a DNA molecule, has the potential to reveal increased risks of particular diseases and facilitate personalized medicine. It is also used in statistical studies and comparison of genomes, leading to preventive medicine. However, the current status of DNA sequencing is vastly time-consuming and expensive. A proposed improvement for this is the use of functionalized nanopore-embedded electrodes, which offer the advantage of an unambiguous distinction of the four nucleic acid bases.

The process of DNA sequencing consists of pre-processing steps, sequencing using the Sanger method, and post-processing in the form of data analysis. The proposed setup for the functionalized nanopore-embedded electrodes involves the use of state-of-the-art density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function method for the investigation of transport properties. This leads to current responses differing by at least one order of magnitude for different bases, providing a robust read-out of the base sequence.

The potential result of implementing this proposed setup is rapid DNA sequencing, which could have significant consequences for the future of genome-related research and healthcare. This could revolutionize the field, making DNA sequencing more accessible and efficient, thereby accelerating advancements in personalized medicine and preventive healthcare.

In the realm of Protein Structure Analysis, the concept of Total Conformational Energy is pivotal. This energy is derived from the lower bound, which is achieved when the protein structure is in its native state. The analytical method is used to derive this lower bound, which has significant implications for protein structure prediction.

Interestingly, the Total Conformational Energy is approximated by the sum of sequence-dependent pairwise contact energies. This approach helps in understanding the energy landscape of proteins, which is crucial for predicting their structures.

The Native Contact Matrix, described as the Go Potential, plays a significant role in this analysis. It is a multiple of the Contact Energy Matrix, which has spectral relations with the Energy Matrix. These spectral relations between the Contact Matrix and Energy Matrix provide valuable insights into the protein's structural properties.

Moreover, the approximations related to one-dimensional protein structures are also considered in this context. These approximations are integral to the overall Protein Structure Analysis, providing a simplified yet informative perspective on protein structures.

"  Intracellular pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes and Rickettsia
rickettsii move within a host cell by polymerizing a comet-tail of actin fibers
that ultimately pushes the cell forward. This dense network of cross-linked
actin polymers typically exhibits a striking curvature that causes bacteria to
move in gently looping paths. Theoretically, tail curvature has been linked to
details of motility by considering force and torque balances from a finite
number of polymerizing filaments. Here we track beads coated with a prokaryotic
activator of actin polymerization in three dimensions to directly quantify the
curvature and torsion of bead motility paths. We find that bead paths are more
likely to have low rather than high curvature at any given time. Furthermore,
path curvature changes very slowly in time, with an autocorrelation decay time
of 200 seconds. Paths with a small radius of curvature, therefore, remain so
for an extended period resulting in loops when confined to two dimensions. When

Intracellular pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes and Rickettsia rickettsii exhibit striking curvature as they move within cells. This movement is facilitated by polymerizing actin fibers, which form a dense network of cross-linked actin polymers. The theoretical link behind this movement is believed to be force and torque balances from a finite number of polymerizing filaments.

The polymerization of actin fibers has been tracked with beads coated with prokaryotic activators and quantified in three dimensions. Interestingly, these actin fibers are more likely to have low rather than high curvature, and any changes in curvature occur very slowly over time. The autocorrelation decay time for these changes is approximately 200 seconds. Despite this, a small radius of curvature can remain for an extended period.

When viewed in three dimensions, the gently looping paths exhibited by these fibers are less evident. Furthermore, there is no significant left- or right-handed bias in torsion. This is also reflected in the motility paths of beads, which exhibit slow changes in curvature and no significant bias towards left or right in 3D.

Conformational fluctuations play a significant role in the binding process of transcription factor proteins. These fluctuations are crucial in locating and binding the target site on the bacterium genome. Interestingly, these conformational fluctuations are optimized in typical bacteria.

The transcription factor proteins binding process itself involves these conformational fluctuations. The process is optimized by adjusting the conformational states spectrum. The optimization criteria aim to minimize the binding time, ideally within an order of magnitude of the thermodynamic limiting binding time. The ideal protein characteristics for this process include instant target recognition.

The adjustment of the conformational states spectrum is achieved by matching the fraction of time spent in more mobile conformations with the target recognition rate. This process is under selective pressure and is a method used for optimization.

Typical bacteria operate in a regime of optimized conformational fluctuations, with numerical estimates suggesting this optimization.

The authors of this study focus on downhill protein folding, using a simple statistical mechanical model for their approach. They compare the protein 1BBL and the WW domain of protein PIN1. The solution for equilibrium in downhill protein folding is exact, while the kinetics are treated in a semi-analytical manner.

The protein 1BBL is a candidate for downhill folding and is comparable in size to the WW domain of protein PIN1. However, there are qualitative differences between the two proteins. The WW domain of protein PIN1 is a two-state folder, unlike protein 1BBL. Despite their similar sizes, there are qualitative differences in their equilibrium and kinetic properties.

The barrierless scenario, which is observed only at low enough temperature, is a condition that is explored in this study.

The Poland-Scheraga Model Generalization is a significant contribution to the understanding of DNA denaturation with external stretching force. This model considers the impact of an external force on DNA denaturation and demonstrates the existence of a force-induced DNA denaturation transition. The model agrees with single-molecule DNA stretching experiments, providing a reliable source of validation.

The model obtains a temperature-force phase diagram, which is a critical tool in understanding the denaturation process under different temperature and force conditions. The model also demonstrates that the melting temperature is lower with a finite stretching force.

The force-induced DNA denaturation transition is of second order, with a loop exponent c of 4ν - 1/2, which has a value of 1.85 in the case of dimensionality d=3. This transition is also demonstrated in the context of the Poland-Scheraga Model Generalization.

"  Small single-domain proteins often exhibit only a single free-energy barrier,
or transition state, between the denatured and the native state. The folding
kinetics of these proteins is usually explored via mutational analysis. A
central question is which structural information on the transition state can be
derived from the mutational data. In this article, we model and structurally
interpret mutational Phi-values for two small beta-sheet proteins, the PIN and
the FBP WW domain. The native structure of these WW domains comprises two
beta-hairpins that form a three-stranded beta-sheet. In our model, we assume
that the transition state consists of two conformations in which either one of
the hairpins is formed. Such a transition state has been recently observed in
Molecular Dynamics folding-unfolding simulations of a small designed
three-stranded beta-sheet protein. We obtain good agreement with the
experimental data (i) by splitting up the mutation-induced free-energy changes
into terms for the two hairpins and for the small hydrophobic core of the
proteins, and (ii) by fitting a single parameter, the relative degree to which
hairpin 1 and 2 are formed in the transition state. The model helps to
understand how mutations affect the folding kinetics of WW domains, and
captures also negative Phi-values that have been difficult to interpret.

Small single-domain proteins, such as the PIN WW domain and the FBP WW domain, have been explored for their folding kinetics via mutational analysis. These proteins are characterized by a single free-energy barrier between their denatured and native state. The transition state of these proteins consists of two conformations with one hairpin formed.

Mutational analysis has been applied to derive structural information on the transition state of these proteins. The analysis has shown good agreement with experimental data, with the mutational Phi-values being split up into terms for two hairpins and terms for a small hydrophobic core. The fitted parameter is the relative degree to which hairpin 1 and 2 are formed in the transition state.

A model for mutational Phi-values has been developed to understand how mutations affect the folding kinetics of WW domains. This model captures negative Phi-values, providing a comprehensive understanding of the folding process.

"  Extracting the intrinsic kinetic information of biological molecule from its
single-molecule kinetic data is of considerable biophysical interest. In this
work, we theoretically investigate the feasibility of inferring single RNA's
intrinsic kinetic parameters from the time series obtained by forced
folding/unfolding experiment done in the light tweezer, where the molecule is
flanked by long double-stranded DNA/RNA handles and tethered between two big
beads. We first construct a coarse-grain physical model of the experimental
system. The model has captured the major physical factors: the Brownian motion
of the bead, the molecular structural transition, and the elasticity of the
handles and RNA. Then based on an analytic solution of the model, a Bayesian
method using Monte Carlo Markov Chain is proposed to infer the intrinsic
kinetic parameters of the RNA from the noisy time series of the distance or
force. Because the force fluctuation induced by the Brownian motion of the bead
and the structural transition can significantly modulate the transition rates
of the RNA, we prove that, this statistic method is more accurate and efficient
than the conventional histogram fitting method in inferring the molecule's
intrinsic parameters.

Prokaryotes do not have introns in their genome. We report the calculations of
stability domains of actin genes for various organisms in the animal, plant and
fungi kingdoms. Actin genes have been chosen because they have been highly
conserved during evolution. In these genes all introns were removed so as to
mimic ancient genes at the time of the early eukaryotic development, i.e.
before introns insertion. Common stability boundaries are found in evolutionary
distant organisms, which implies that these boundaries date from the early
origin of eukaryotes. In general boundaries correspond with introns positions
of vertebrates and other animals actins, but not much for plants and fungi. The
sharpest boundary is found in a locus where fungi, algae and animals have
introns in positions separated by one nucleotide only, which identifies a
hot-spot for insertion. These results suggest that some introns may have been
incorporated into the genomes through a thermodynamic driven mechanism, in
agreement with previous observations on human genes. They also suggest a

Actin genes are a type of eukaryotic genes that are highly conserved during evolution. They are found in various kingdoms such as the Animal Kingdom, Plant Kingdom, and Fungi Kingdom. Interestingly, actin genes have had all their introns removed to mimic ancient genes. This modification has allowed them to be stable across evolutionary boundaries, making them common in evolutionary distant organisms.

The origin of actin genes can be traced back to early eukaryotic development. Introns in actin genes correspond with stability boundaries in vertebrates and other animals. However, this correlation is not as strong in plants and fungi. The sharpest boundary is found in a locus where fungi, algae, and animals have introns separated by one nucleotide. This suggests that introns were incorporated into genomes through a thermodynamic driven mechanism.

It's worth noting that the mechanism of intron insertion is different for plants and animals. This difference is further highlighted by the fact that prokaryotes have no introns in their genome structure. Eukaryotic genes, on the other hand, have a protein coding sequence split into exons and introns. Exons are protein coding sequence fragments, while introns are non-coding DNA stretches.

"  Intracellular transport along microtubules or actin filaments, powered by
molecular motors such as kinesins, dyneins or myosins, has been recently

Intracellular transport, a crucial process within cells, takes place on microtubules or actin filaments. This process is powered by molecular motors, which include kinesins, dyneins, and myosins. The function of these molecular motors is to provide the energy required for intracellular transport.

The movement and behavior of these molecular motors can be modeled using one-dimensional driven lattice gases. This modeling approach is not only used for intracellular transport but also includes extended particles and defects.

To gain a deeper understanding of this process, single molecule experiments are conducted. These experiments aim to measure the average motor density and locate the position of traffic jams within the cell. A tracer particle is used in these experiments, which have been commented on in preliminary experiments conducted in living cells.
